Wow, Angelina Jolie has <a href="http://www.variety.com/VR1117950446.html">officially signed on</a> to the movie version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451191145/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite></a> to bring Dagny Taggart to life. The <a href="/2006/04/27/brangelina-as-dagnyjohn.aspx">rumors</a> were true!
</p>

Jolie is exactly how I would have wanted Dagny to look. <img src="http://BBROWN.INFO/emoticons/smile.png" border="0" /> She claims to be a big fan, so maybe she'll give a great performance. I certainly hope so.

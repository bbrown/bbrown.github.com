<br />This <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/science/07/16/coolsc.animalcam/">documentary</a> sounds incredible. I've long imagined what the world must look like to an insect crawling through a grass forest. The closest this filmmaker got is on a tarantula, but that's close enough.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I've only read the first Harry Potter book and I considered it quite derivative. It wasn't anything particularly special, but I have pretty high standards when it comes to fiction.<br /><br />I read A.S. Byatt's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/07/opinion/07BYAT.html?ex=1372910400&amp;en=b71cff68ee4ba8be&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">review</a> in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"><cite>The New York Times</cite></a> and it left a pretty bad impression. Freudian analysis has always, naturally, left me cold. Then I read <a href="http://www.forgottendelights.com/">Dianne Durante</a>'s <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,6623176%5E7583,00.html">review</a> and it was the complete opposite. The worldviews of the two couldn't be more different and more patent&#x2014;some philosophic detection should easily uncover the antipodes.<br /><br /><br />

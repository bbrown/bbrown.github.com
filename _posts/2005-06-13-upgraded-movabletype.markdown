<br />Just upgraded MovableType from 2.661 to 3.17. It looks like ass. Luckily, there's finally some useful features in there like checkboxes for batch actions.<br /><br />In related news, <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> just keeps getting better and better. I'm still moving old files over from the old ColdFusion-based system to the new TXP-based one. Once I've got all of those transferred (blog goes last since it's the most-frequently updated part of my site), then I'm going to use MovableType to generate PHP-based redirects for all past blog entries.<br /><br />Once all that happens, I can finally drop the $30/month hosting for bbrown.info and move it over to the host for <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/">Found on the Web</a> and <a href="http://www.fivebrowns.com/">Five Browns</a>, among others. And my hosting bill per month will effectively drop from $49.85 per month to just $19.95 (and actually I think I prepaid for two years, so it's only $15.95 per month).<br /><br />And that'll be sweet.<br /><br /><br />

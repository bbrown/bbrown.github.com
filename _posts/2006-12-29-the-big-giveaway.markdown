As I <a href="/2006/12/15/time-to-party.aspx">mentioned previously</a>, Bob Parsons gave away a bunch of money at this year's Christmas party. I wasn't really sure how much was distributed because I just wasn't keeping track, assuming (incorrectly) that there'd be a list of winners in email the next day. A press release that was sent out today indicates that the total figure was approximately $300,000 in cash. So I was a little high in my estimation.

<p>
The other bombshell in the press release was that they're expecting the annual revenue to increase 80% over 2005's results to a total of $241 million. I don't know what Quick Blog's share of that was (not that I could share it if I did) but I'm sure it was a big chunk. <img src="http://BBROWN.INFO/emoticons/smile.png" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, that revenue figure is phenomenal. When I started, they were quoting $100 million as the annual revenue. We're making money hand over fist!

[UPDATE (1/1/2007): Still no press release on the official site, but here's <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/1229sr-godaddy1229-ON.html">an article about it</a>.]

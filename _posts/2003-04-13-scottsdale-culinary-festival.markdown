<br />I went to the <a href="http://www.scottsdaleculinaryfestival.org/">Scottsdale Culinary Festival</a> today and spent $30 stuffing my pie hole (and <a href="/values/people/sandibrown.cfm">Sandi</a>'s, natch) with comestibles. Aside from the good food, we got an eyeful of the Scottsdale well-to-do and their <em>faux</em> racks. I think the valuation of the plastic surgery being flaunted there was probably in the mid six figures at least. It was amazing the lengths to which women (and men to a lesser extent) would go to attract attention and notice.<br /><br /><br />

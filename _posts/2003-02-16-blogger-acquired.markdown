<br />Wow, <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/5195812.htm">Google has bought Blogger</a>. I'm not sure what to think of this. If you didn't know, this blog and its sister, <a href="http://www.paintinginthepark.com/blog/">Found on the Web</a>, are run through the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> system.<br /><br />What is this going to mean? Why would Google buy Blogger? I can completely understand why owner <a href="http://www.evhead.com/">Evan Williams</a> would sell <a href="http://www.pyra.com/">Pyra Labs</a>, Blogger's developer. It's a golden opportunity, completely dwarfing <a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/blogger.htm" title="Dan Bricklin's Trellix Corporation invests in Pyra, staving off immediate collapse.">other</a> <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$923" title="O'Reilly invests in Pyra, Dave gets pissed.">fortunate</a> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/news_archive.pyra?which=2002_08_01_news_archive.xml" title="Blogger saved by Brazil partnership">opportunities</a>. Gillmor, in his <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000802.shtml#000802">eJournal</a> on the subject, opines that this deal will<br /><blockquote><br />... help readers of weblogs and other information find and collect material from a variety of sites.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />It's hard to see how this all fits in with <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> since its innovations have all been in accessing information better. <a href="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</a> made it easier to find information in the newsgroups, though that property&#x2014;acquired from defunct D&#xE9;ja News&#x2014;has never been integrated into the main Google search. <a href="http://images.google.com/">Google Images</a> made it easier to find graphic content amid the texual Web. <a href="http://froogle.google.com/">Froogle</a> promises to facilitate product searching among e-commerce sites. What's Bloogle going to bring to the picture? Google search is already indexing blogs, including this one, on a regular basis&#x2014;Google's crawler is currently the most frequent visitor to this site, sadly. <a href="http://google.blogspace.com/archives/000837" title="Natch.">There</a> <a href="http://inmyexperience.com/archives/000328.shtml" title="Interesting take.">is</a> <a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/02/030216bloggings_ne.html">a</a> <a href="http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/track.asp?id=4324981" title="Wow, that's a lot of linkage!">great</a> <a href="http://www.daypop.com/search?q=link%3Aweblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000802.shtml%23000802&amp;t=w&amp;max=672" title="Two positions on the Daypop Top 40">deal</a> <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/02/16/0728230" title="Pretty vitriolic.">of</a> <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/23612" title="Racuous discussion on MetaFilter, of course.">speculation</a> <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archived.blah/2/01/2003#1138">about</a> <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/005129.php" title="Anil's typical rant">what</a> <a href="http://rc3.org/cgi-bin/less.pl?arg=4931">Google</a> <a href="http://www.ratcliffe.com/bizblog/2003/02/15.html#a889" title="Interesting notion.">will</a> <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/02/16" title="Dave's probably going to get all pouty about this: 'But Google, I've got a blog-making tool and I came up with blogs.'">get</a> <a href="http://boingboing.net/2003_02_01_archive.html#90330803" title="Cory Doctorow obviously has an opinion.">out</a> <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/02/google_pyra_and.shtml" title="Ben and Mena Trott, makers of Movable Type, speculate about Google's intentions.">of</a> <a href="http://www.interconnected.org/notes/2003/02/Google_buy_Pyra.txt">this</a> <a href="http://interconnected.org/notes/2003/02/Google_buy_Pyra_2.txt">deal</a>.<br /><br />If <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> had done this, I wouldn't even have blinked since it fits right in with their portal strategy. They've got <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Groups</a> and <a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/">GeoCities</a>, among many other such properties.

Google is <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/today.html" title="Look particularly at #2, though #4 and #7 seem applicable.">none of these things</a>.<br /><br />[UPDATE] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/17/technology/17GOOG.html"><cite>The New York Times</cite></a> weighs in. <a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2003_02_16_blogarc.htm#90331511">Tony Pierce offers an insight</a>.<br /><br /><br />

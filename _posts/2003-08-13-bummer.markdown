<br />My <a href="2003_07_27_diamonds.cfm#105971647702168989">moneymaking dreams</a> (as far as this site goes, at least) are dashed: Google has rejected my AdSense application. Apparently, this site is too personal. You heard it here first, folks!<div align="center"><img src="/images/logo76.gif" width="500" height="120" alt="branded too personal by Google!" style="padding:10px;" /></div><br /><br /><br />

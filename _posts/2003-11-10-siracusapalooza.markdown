<br />John Siracusa has done it again with his new <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/reviews/003/panther/macosx-10.3-1.html">review of Panther</a> over at <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/">ArsTechnica</a>. In this thorough review, Siracusa grinds his usual metadata ax but details things not covered elsewhere:<ul><li>Panther automatically defrags files under 20MB on open.</li><li>Panther automatically moves frequently-accessed files to the faster parts of your hard drive for easier caching.</li><li>Expos&#xE9; is a lot richer of a feature than looking at all the windows at once: you can do drag and drop as well as use the arrow keys to navigate.</li><li>FreeBSD has implemented a feature called "kqueue" that implements a polling substitute at the kernel level thus obviating the latency that polling creates.</li><li>Apple's taken a courageous (insofar as marketing can be deemed courageous) leap in not continuing the <em>faux</em>-fur motif established in Jaguar.</li></ul>There's lots, lots more in his review to enjoy. I recommend it highly.<br /><br />[UPDATE (11/12/03): Matt Gemmell has more interesting (and obscure) <a href="http://www.scotlandsoftware.com/index.php/dev/mac/obscure_but_cool_panther_features.html">Panther features</a> over at his blog.]<br /><br /><br />

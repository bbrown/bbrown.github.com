<br />I cannot believe my eyes. In fact, my retinas are only now adjusting to the non-suckage as I close the site. At first, I thought it was one of those well-conceived examples of what not to do <strong>ever</strong>. Unfortunately, this North Dakota bank is near its centennial and protects $265 million in assets. It is, without a doubt, the worst looking site I've ever seen.<br /><br />I could rattle off a laundry list of bad design decisions, horrible usability, gaffes, and mistakes but I think it's putridness is self-evident. I don't normally demean site designs because I know that it's hard work and often compromises and concessions must be made, but this is beyond the pale.<br /><br />With that introduction, I present you the aptly-titled <a href="http://www.wowbanking.com/">WOWBanking site</a>&#x2014;I guess they decided against JawDroppinglyBadBanking&#x2014;and apologize for any retinal damage it might inflict on you.<br /><br />[One sidenote: don't miss the <a href="http://www.wowbanking.com/kids.htm">Kids Zone</a>, which is exactly what I thought the main site was when I first saw the link.]<br /><br /><br />

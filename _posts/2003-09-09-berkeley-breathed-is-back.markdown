<br />According to an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45450-2003Sep8.html">article</a> in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/"><cite>Washington Post</cite></a>&#x2014;though there's nothing on his <a href="http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/">official site</a>, Berke Breathed is developing a new Sunday comic strip that will start on November 23rd entitled "Opus." I was a huge fan of Bloom County growing up&#x2014;even writing in to <cite>The Arizona Republic</cite> petitioning to save it when he was considering quitting&#x2014;and Opus was always my favorite character. In fact, my handle in childhood was Opus, shortened from Opus Z. Hacker when that moniker's unfortunate verbal pronunciation was used in repeated flames by a certain ne'er-do-well named Morpheus.<br /><br /><br />

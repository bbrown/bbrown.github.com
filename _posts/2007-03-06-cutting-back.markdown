I just saved $20 a month by switching to <a href="http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/packProg/channelChart1.jsp?assetId=1000005">Family</a>!
</p>
<p>
I'm actually quite excited by this because the 40 channels in the Family plan (plus locals) represents over 150 less than what I had yesterday. Less channels equals less channel surfing, less opportunity to discover new shows to get hooked on, and, well, less <cite>Law and Order</cite>. I watched <a href="http://bbrown.info/2005/02/24/forget-welcome-2.aspx">too</a> <a href="http://bbrown.info/2005/01/21/watch-for-falling-excuses-2.aspx">much</a> of that&#x2014;sometimes up to three hours a night if I hadn't seen the episodes already&#x2014;and it'll do me good to restrict my viewing to just the new episodes on NBC.

<p>
It's already paying dividends since we got through the three DVDs from Netflix that we've had sitting around for the last two weeks and I balanced the checkbook and payed all the bills! It's not quite no television, which I don't think my family could do but it's as close as we're going to get.

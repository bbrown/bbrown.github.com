<br />I'm not a fan of George Bush by any stretch (I voted for him because I could not vote for Al Gore ever) and the caliber of our federal representation continually saddens me, but <a href="http://www.thousandreasons.org/">Thousand Reasons Not to Re-Elect George Bush</a> deepens that disdain. Many of the things that the site upbraids Bush for aren't really the province of government action (or shouldn't be), but a lot of it is spot on. He represents so-called crony capitalism, one that does not prize efficiency or innovation.<br /><br />How does a radical for capitalism vote in this sort of situation?<br /><br /><br />

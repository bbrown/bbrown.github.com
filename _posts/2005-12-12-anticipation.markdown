<br />Tomorrow's the big day (barring anything really nasty) when we release version 1.0 of Quick Blog. I can't wait! It's been a roller coaster of deadlines for months and we're finally at the end. But this end is really just another beginning because we've got a metric ass-ton of stuff planned and we're going to be releasing fast and furiously.<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

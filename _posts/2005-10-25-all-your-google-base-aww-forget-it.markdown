<br />Google Base is coming soon, <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-10-25-n57.html">apparently</a>. From the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dirson/55908013/">screenshot</a>, it seems like some sort of <a href="http://www.craigslist.com/">Craigslist</a> knock-off. It makes a lot of sense, but I mostly can't wait to see how they implement it. Will it be generalizable to non-items? To more general information storage and retrieval? Let's wait and see! {<a href="http://www.waxy.org/links/">via</a>}<br /><br />[UPDATE: In a completely unprecedented move, Google has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/10/rumor-of-day.html">publicly commented</a> on this&#x2014;even if rather obliquely. I'm not sure what to make of that. From the Google Blogoscoped entry, it sounds a lot more robust than a comparison with Google Sitemaps would warrant.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />My friend Larry and his friend (I'd consider him my own too, now) <a href="http://www.seanjs.com/">Sean</a> just left this morning. (This morning is more of a conceptual notion since this post is technically going out in the morning.) Larry just finished law school and is moving to Washington, D.C. to clerk for a judge.<br /><br />They were in town because Sean is accompanying Larry on the San Diego to St. Louis leg. Sean is <a href="http://www.seanjs.com/2002/">chronicling the journey</a> on his site in his inimitable style. In the <a href="http://www.seanjs.com/2002/day2.html">Day 2 entry</a>, Sean makes some pretty absurd claims about <a href="http://www.laserquest.com/laserquest.html">Laser Quest</a>. Just because the guy gets a lucky game (scoring 1000+ points), suddenly he's an expert about laser game strategy. He speaks derisively about people who find a "magic hiding place"&#x2014;that's me he's referring to, by the way. You should have seen my spot though. It had awesome views of four different areas and I ranked at second place (behind Sean). All in all, I had a great time shooting my friends and various small kids.<br /><br /><br />

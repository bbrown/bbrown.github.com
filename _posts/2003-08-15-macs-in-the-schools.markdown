<br />My wife has gone back to school after a restful summer off and she was offered (as was every teacher) an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibook/">iBook</a> with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/airport/">wireless</a>. She opted not to take one since she'll be on maternity leave and prefers to keep her grades the old-fashioned way.<br /><br />I got curious about the details of the program since I hadn't heard a peep about it in the Macintosh community so I emailed the <a href="http://www.pvusd.k12.az.us/">Paradise Valley Unified School District</a>. I received a quick reply from Jeff Billings, Director of Technology:<blockquote>We roll out a lot of iBooks to teachers.  Started our mobility and wireless project about a year and a half ago.  We have about 10,000 computers and are 74% Macintosh.  All of our teachers are mobile with iBooks/laptops and we're embracing handheld technologies (Palm and DANA) in a pretty big way.  Finally, we're just now starting our conversion to OSX - the teachers love it.</blockquote><br />Okay, so I didn't find out exactly how many iBooks were distributed and I don't know exactly how many teachers are in the district. Still, it's very heartening given the resistance to Apple in the enterprise noted earlier.<br /><br /><br />

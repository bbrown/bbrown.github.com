Tonight I was absolutely delighted to have found an archive of <a href="http://thecertaintysite.com/index.html">James Sedgwick's The Certainty Site</a>. It is an excellent, accessible guide to the Objectivist epistemology and I fondly remember checking it frequently as it was being created. I'm so glad someone preserved it.

Now if only someone had done the same for E.G. Ross' <cite>The Objective American</cite>. That was an exceptional daily essay on wide-ranging topics written in the 90s that did not outlive its creator.

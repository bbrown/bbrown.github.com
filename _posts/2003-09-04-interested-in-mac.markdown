<br />If you're interested in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Macintosh</a>&#x2014;and you should be if you're not&#x2014;go to <a href="http://www.compusa.com/">CompUSA</a> and get their <a href="http://dealmac.com/articles/55444.html?sess=bff5ebef893a2daa9cbbdb07fd0ab59c">no interest till March 2005 deal</a>. 20 months is plenty of time to pay off the loan, making this a real sweet deal&#x2014;even though it means that you have to set foot in a CompUSA. Think of it as helping a good cause.<br /><br /><br />

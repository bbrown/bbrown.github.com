<br />The stuff over at <a href="http://www.blogcensus.net/?page=tools">BlogCensus.net</a> is pretty neat. They've made available their <a href="http://www.blogcensus.net/?page=Download">raw data files</a> for anyone's data mining. They also expose their tool's data through a Web services <a href="http://www.blogcensus.net/?page=API"><acronym title="Application Programmer Interface">API</acronym></a>.<br /><br />I don't know that I'll do anything with it, but I'm glad to know that I could. I can't imagine the bandwidth they must have to be able to offer up a 2.9GB file to all comers.<br /><br /><br />

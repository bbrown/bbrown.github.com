<p>I'm always interested in famous people who make metropolitan Phoenix their home. My wife used to serve Jack Lemmon coffee at Paradise Valley Mall when we both worked at the McDonald's there; my mother-in-law was once in line at her bank behind Randy Johnson, who was cashing a $50,000 endorsement check from Nike according to the teller&#x2014;clearly violating her fiduciary responsibility for confidentiality; and my wife's co-worker's husband used to ship Rick Schroeder's packages when he worked at a Mailboxes, Etc. It would be fascinating to list the celebrities who live in the Valley.</p>
<p>This <cite>New York Times</cite> article lists <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/15/garden/15JENN.html?ex=1397361600&amp;en=3e0359841e9017c4&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">one surprising one</a>. Okay, maybe it's not that surprising, but I would have thought she'd be a California girl. Oh, and a five-minute trip through various government web sites found her address using only information from the article. That's the aspect of the Web that's a little scary.</p>

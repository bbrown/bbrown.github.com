<br />I've had <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/you-stole-my-bandwidth.cfm">plenty of experience</a> with <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/bandwidth-theft-part-two.cfm">bandwidth theft</a>, mostly from youngsters using my daughters' pictures in comments on MySpace. I've replaced these pictures with <a href="/gallery/kimberly/Images/40.jpg">traditional</a> <a href="/gallery/kimberly/Images/40-old.jpg">punishments</a> to my continual delight. I've even got so good at replacing that I can replace a hotlinked picture with one of these within 15 minutes of discovering it in my logs.<br /><br />I guess some MySpace cadets and LiveJournalians have noticed this and now they've started hotlinking my disgusting pictures to blast their friends. That means that replacing those pictures with even more disgusting photos would really just be playing into their hands. What's a blogger to do?<br /><br />Replace them with <a href="/gallery/annie/Images/15.jpg">Norman Rockwell paintings cross-stitched by prisoners</a>? Ho hum, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&amp;friendID=7640584">I</a> <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/hesmypoison/10906.html">guess</a> <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/hotpinkcaviar/13303.html?thread=25335#t25335">so</a>.<br /><br /><br />

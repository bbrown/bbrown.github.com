Today's our <a href="http://inside.godaddy.com/daddy-employees-blast/"><acronym title="Employee Appreciation Initiative">EAI</acronym></a> at work: we're going to have lunch at <a href="http://foodconnect.org/phxmarket/" title="Never been but I love Food Truck Thursdays at the Whole Foods near work">Food Truck Friday</a> and then go cruising through the desert with <a href="http://www.gogreenzebra.com/scottsdale/" title="I can't believe GreenZebra.com was already taken. That sucks!">Green Zebra Adventures</a>. I even get to drive the Go Daddy Van for the first time.

It rained last night and this morning so I bet that's going to make the offroading even more exciting!

[UPDATE (12/17/2012): I had a really great time. Driving the Go Daddy Van&mdash;a Dodge Sprinter, I believe&mdash;was a lot more nerve-wracking than I expected. I felt a lot of responsibility to not injure my co-workers and the steering was a lot more squishy than on my MINI Cooper. Food Truck Friday was a big hit even though there were fewer trucks than I thought. Green Zebra Adventures was terrific! We drove two to a Tomcar and my passenger gave me explicit instructions to go nuts. I don't think I disappointed: I drove that sucker hard and even scared myself a couple of times.]

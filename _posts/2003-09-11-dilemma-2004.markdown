<br />After reading this <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101030915-483293,00.html">opinion piece</a>, I'm more annoyed than <a href="2003_07_13_diamonds.cfm#105845961107754627">ever</a> by George Bush and his presidency. He's more profligate than the Democrat that preceded him with far less excuse (Reagan could at least say that the Democrats controlled Congress) and he's a babbling idiot.<br /><br />His politics are a disgusting mishmash of altruistic tendencies and self-centered cronyism. I think he is arguably the worst president of the century&#x2014;Gerald Ford was at least mostly ineffective&#x2014;from the perspective of presidentiality. I would definitely say that LBJ, FDR, and JFK were the worst presidents insofar as they projected the power of government into areas that were totally unwarranted.<br /><br />That means that Election 2004 is going to be Dilemma 2004. Much more so than usual.<br /><br />[UPDATE: I should probably stop griping since I'm just <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/ny-woafgh093447102sep09,0,668085.story?coll=ny-worldnews-print">helping the terrorists</a>.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (9/17/03): More reasons to dislike the Bush administration, <a href="http://www.525reasons.com/">525</a> of them to be exact.]<br /><br /><br />

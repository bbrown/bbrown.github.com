<br />A <a href="http://www.wired.com/"><cite>Wired</cite></a> interview examines the inception of a <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.08/start.html?pg=12">new cable channel</a> set to debut this summer called <a href="http://realitycentral.com/">Reality Central</a>.<br /><br />I should pitch them my own reality show concept entitled "Lifestyles of the Poor and Obscure." Costs should be pretty minimal, since it's just repackaged <a href="http://www.fox.com/cops/"><cite>COPS</cite></a> episodes and <a href="http://www.jerryspringer.com/"><cite>Jerry Springer</cite></a> clips.<br /><br />I think these two questions and answers are telling:<br /><blockquote><p><strong>How will you cultivate new fans?</strong><br />We'll expand the base by making it more accessible, and foreign shows will be a big part of that. Some are much racier.</p><p><strong>How far will you go?</strong><br />Full-frontal nudity. As a basic cable network, nudity is OK but full-on sex isn't. We may explore racier content as pay-per-view specials.</p></blockquote><br />I think they know quite well what will draw viewers, eh?<br /><br /><br />

<br />If you don't read <a href="http://www.theonion.com/"><cite>The Onion</cite></a>, then you're missing out. Actually, you're a dork and need to press ALT+F4 (Windows) or CMD+W (Mac) <em>tout de suite</em>. <cite>The Onion</cite> is a consistently hilarious take on current events that has some of the best writers around. Plus, it's completely free online! Oh, and they feature <a href="http://www.redmeat.com/redmeat/current/index.html">Red Meat cartoons</a> before they're available on the author's site.<br /><br />Turns out, they're also <a href="https://www.business2.com/subscribers/articles/mag/print/0,1643,51413,00.html">making <em>beaucoup argent</em></a>. Glad to hear it. (We now resume our regularly-scheduled, French-free programming.)<br /><br /><br />

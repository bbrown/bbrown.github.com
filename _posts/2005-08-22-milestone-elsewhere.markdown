<br />I just hit a blogging milestone this morning over at <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/">my other blog</a>: I posted my <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/archives/2005/08/milestone">2,000 entry</a>!<br /><br />It's been a very busy year: I left Blogger as my host on May 9, 2004 and exported 698 entries; when I moved from MovableType to WordPress on January 7, 2005, I exported 1,061 entries. That means that in the <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=11&amp;d1=7&amp;y1=2001&amp;m2=8&amp;d2=22&amp;y2=2005&amp;ti=on">1,385 days</a> I've been publishing Found on the Web, I've averaged 1.45 posts per day. In the Blogger era, I was doing 0.76 posts per day. In the MovableType, that shot up to 1.49 posts per day. In the current era, I've been averaging 4.15 per day.<br /><br />I don't know if that means WordPress is more productive, I'm less busy, I've become more efficient, or I'm more dedicated. At present trends, I will hit the 3,000 entry mark 239 days from now&#x2014;April 18, 2006. We'll see how that goes.<br /><br /><br />

<br /><a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave</a>'s been on a vigorous pace lately, wound up with talk about BloggerCon and <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000985.html">presidential candidate blogs</a>. His puffery reminds me of an <a href="2003_08_10_diamonds.cfm#106078746075412167">earlier entry of mine</a> about the nature of blogging.<br /><br />Remember, blogging is simply reverse-chronological ordering of HTML with optional commenting and syndication. It's not some mystical endeavor that elevates your writing. It's not some huge revolution that will give the masses a voice. It's not the future of political campaigns. For all the hype that <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>, <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/">Movable Type</a>, and <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a> get, their reach is far, far exceeded by <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>. Do you ever hear any of the hypesters talk up LiveJournal? Curious, that. Could it be that LiveJournal doesn't fit the hyperbolic mold?<br /><br />And that, fellow bloggers, is today's dose of perspective.<br /><br />[NOTE: I like blogging tools. It's much easier to open a URL than to load up <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a>, make an entry, and <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> it to my server. I just don't operate under the delusion that blogging is any greater than the sum of those parts.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (10/13/03): Clemens Vasters has some <a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c5704942-857d-42f5-b947-6614051eae60">additional thoughts</a> on why BloggerCon was a failure.]<br /><br /><br />

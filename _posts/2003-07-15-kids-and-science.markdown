<br />I found out yesterday that Bertrand Brinley wrote a novel about the <a href="http://www.madscientistsclub.com/">Mad Scientists Club</a> called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1930900228/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>The Big Kerplop</cite></a> that has been out of print for quite some time. <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> had a <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/11/1834255&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=134&amp;tid=188&amp;tid=192">review</a> of it yesterday that really whetted my appetite and left me nostalgic for those book series that I voraciously devoured&#x2014;series like The Three Investigators, Encyclopedia Brown, the Hardy Boys, and Einstein Anderson. Each of these books had a common thread: kids using their minds to solve problems that baffle adults. This really resonated with me and I probably read every book in those series; no small task considering that there must've been 400 Hardy Boys books.<br /><br />On a related note, I will definitely have to remember <a href="http://www.scitoys.com/">SciToys</a> in the future. I want my girls to grow up intellectually curious and exposed to the wonders of science through the miracle of <a href="http://www.scitoys.com/scitoys/scitoys/thermo/thermo2.html" title="What a redundant URL!">a film can cannon</a>.<br /><br /><br />

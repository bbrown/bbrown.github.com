<br />As regular readers may know, nearly all my sites are hosted with <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?wcbrown">Dreamhost</a>&#x2014;this one's hosted at <a href="http://www.uplinkearth.com/">Uplink Earth</a> but that's only until the blog software is released. Dreamhost is great because they've got an excellent control panel, ever-increasing quotas on bandwidth and storage, and excellent support. I've prepaid with them for two years and I've got another two years paid for after that because of referrals.<br /><br />I catch a lot of flack at work about that. "Why don't you host with Go Daddy? Do you not like Go Daddy?" The price is right&#x2014;free for employees&#x2014;but I'm incredibly lazy. Hell, I've been with Uplink Earth for well over a year even though I'm paying $29.90 per month and should have migrated it to Dreamhost a long time ago. Changing hosts is hard! (Okay, it's not hard but it's not easy enough for me.)<br /><br />I used to recommend Dreamhost to everyone I knew because its value was unbeaten by Go Daddy. That was very hard to do for me because I really wanted to recommend Go Daddy's hosting. It was still a great deal, but I couldn't suggest it knowing that something better was out there. These were my friends and people trusting me for a recommendation and I'm not about to shill for my employer. My last employer begged its employees to do that and I hated them for it.<br /><br />Thankfully, Go Daddy <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/11-02-2005/0004206353">today</a> sent Dreamhost a packin'. Our new hosting plans are <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/hosting/shared.asp">fricking unbelievable</a>. That kind of bandwidth, storage, and database offering is unprecedented in my experience. If you've got a domain to host, Go Daddy is the place for you. Seriously.<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

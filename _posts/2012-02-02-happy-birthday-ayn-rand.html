If you're <a href="http://rationaljenn.blogspot.com/2012/01/in-which-i-wade-into-it.html" title="Please keep your voices down so the neighbors don't hear.">worried</a> about the public perception of Objectivism and its adherents, <a href="http://www.hblist.com/randsday/" title="There's another movement out there that made its founder's birthday a holiday and renamed the day. We're not very fond of that crowd.">Randsday</a> is a lot more damaging than <a href="http://www.checkingpremises.org/" title="This site is, however, quite damaging to certain adherents.">Checking Premises</a>. (I linked to Harry Binswanger's site because he's the one that originated the idea, not because I think he is damaging. He's one of the best Objectivists out there.)

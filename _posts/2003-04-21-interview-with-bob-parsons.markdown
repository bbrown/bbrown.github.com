<br />I register all of my domains through <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> because you can't beat its price: $8.95/year. I equate it with <a href="http://www.iflyswa.com/">Southwest Airlines</a> since it is profitable, customer-focused, lighthearted, and value-driven. I would work there in a heartbeat if my ASP skills leaned more towards .NET.<br /><br />So I read a recent <a href="http://meet-the-makers.com/conversations/parsons/">interview with Bob Parsons</a>, GoDaddy's president and founder, with relish. It cleared up a couple of questions I had about GoDaddy and also gave me some insight into the corporate philosophy, which is enmeshed with its founder/president like <a href="http://www.apple.com/">another company</a> I know.<br /><br /><br />

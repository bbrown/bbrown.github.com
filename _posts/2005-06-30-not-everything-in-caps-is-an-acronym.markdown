<br />I just read a statement that the scanner protocol called <a href="http://www.twain.org/">TWAIN</a> stood for "Technology Without A Name" and I thought, "Wow, that's an awesome fact." Being the curious person I am, I decided to investigate.<br /><br />Sadly, it's <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=twain">false</a> and the official site <a href="http://www.twain.org/faq.htm#What%20is%20TWAIN%20an%20acronym%20for">confirms</a> that it's really just acronym-looking.<br /><br />[UPDATE: I probably should have just went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twain">Wikipedia</a>.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 2: Though a case could certainly be made that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Apcmcia">PCMCIA</a> stands for "People Can't Memorize Computer Industry Acronyms."]<br /><br /><br />

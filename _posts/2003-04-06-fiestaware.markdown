<br /><a href="/values/people/sandibrown.cfm">Sandi</a> and I have been <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Recreation/Collecting/Food_and_Drink_Related/Kitchenware/China_and_Pottery/Fiesta/?il=1">collecting </a> <a href="http://www.hlchina.com/">Fiestaware</a> for several years now, amassing both the place settings as well as various serving accoutrements.<br /><br />It's hard to find these accoutrements in some of the more interesting colors since you're usually limited to open stock at the department stores. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> to the rescue! I've discovered a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/598204/bbrown-20/">Fiestaware store</a> that stocks almost the entire spectrum of <a href="http://www.megachina.com/">Fiestaware</a> in almost the <a href="http://www.mediumgreen.com/fiesta/colors.html">entire spectrum of colors</a>. By the way, we collect <a href="http://www.fiestawarefiesta.com/">Fiestaware</a> because it comes in neat colors&#x2014;making a dinner table full of the dishes more festive&#x2014;and it's fairly affordable, unless you get into the <a href="http://www.mediumgreen.com/cgi-bin/fiesta.cgi">rare pieces</a>.<br /><br /><br />

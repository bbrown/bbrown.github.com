<br />Apparently, the Objectivist-oriented art magazine <a href="http://www.aristos.org/"><cite>Aristos</cite></a> is back <a href="http://www.aristos.org/aris-03/ednote-1.htm">online</a>. The magazine&#x2014;though I guess e-zine would be more proper&#x2014;is edited by Louis Torres and Michelle Marder Kamhi, authors of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812693736/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon page on the book"><cite>What Art Is: The Esthetic Theory of Ayn Rand</cite></a>. <a href="http://www.aristos.org/whatart/wai.htm" title="Online supplement to What Art Is"><cite>WAI</cite></a> is a weighty critical examination of Ayn Rand's theory of aesthetics, incompletely laid out primarily in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451149165/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon page for the book"><cite>The Romantic Manifesto</cite></a> and also throughout the rest of her corpus. Sometimes the points they make are niggling, but I think they've really analyzed her theories and firmed up some of the weaker areas. I especially liked their treatment of music, an area of aesthetics that Ayn Rand herself admitted she hadn't been able to tackle effectively.<br /><br />Oh yeah, so <a href="http://www.aristos.org/"><cite>Aristos</cite></a> is back. The neatest thing in their return is the features on <a href="http://www.aristos.org/schaefer/js-page.htm">Jack Schaefer</a>, author of the excellent Western novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553271105/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon page on the book. The book is way better than the movie."><cite>Shane</cite></a>. Apparently, <a href="http://www.tnt.tv/" title="They know drama. And they know all about plastering a program with commercials, too.">TNT</a> has made a <a href="http://www.tnt.tv/Title/Display/0,5918,437110,00.html">version</a> of <a href="http://www.aristos.org/aris-03/monte.htm" title="Aristos review"><cite>Monte Walsh</cite></a> that is very well-done. I remembered seeing a commercial for the movie and thinking that it was worthwhile to view, but never knowing that it was a Schaefer Western. I think Tom Selleck is a wonderful Western star and TNT seems to be making the most of that.<br /><br />I must confess to also never even knowing that Schaefer had written more than <cite>Shane</cite>.<br /><br /><br />

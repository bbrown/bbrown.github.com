<br /><a href="http://www.aceshardware.com/read.jsp?id=50000347">Very interesting article on scalability</a>. This site, getting 15 page views on a great day, probably wouldn't benefit from such an article. My employer is currently implementing a redesign using the Java-based Vignette CMS that runs on four times as many servers and probably couldn't handle a tenth of the load. And each one of those servers could mop the floor with their server and then whoop their ass for leaving streaks, to use a comical phrase from <a href="http://www.roydmercer.com/main.htm" title="Variations on a Theme: Integrating 'Ass Whooping' Into Every Conversation">Roy D. Mercer</a>.<br /><br /><br />

<br />Longhorn will <a href="http://www.nforcershq.com/article3068.html">shed the "My"</a> in all of those special Windows folders. So "My Documents" becomes just "Documents." Let's see, do I make the joke about Mac OS X having that since 2001, the one about having to wait till the end of 2006 for this feature, or the one about how I thought Longhorn was trimming features?<br /><br />I think I'll just point out another example of Microsoft's slothful copying of other companies: they announced <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/resource/article/0,aid,120968,pg,1,RSS,RSS,00.asp">MSN Virtual Earth</a> last week after Google announced <a href="http://www.google.com/press/factorytour.html">Google Earth</a> a week before. And it's already <a href="http://newrecruit.org/archives/2005/may/googlekeyhole">out in beta</a>.<br /><br />I predict that MSN will soon <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-05-22-n83.html">announce a machine translation service</a> that doesn't suck and will be available early next year.<br /><br />[UPDATE (6/3/05): Did I say "end of 2006"? I think I meant <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=23695">middle of 2007</a>.]<br /><br /><br />

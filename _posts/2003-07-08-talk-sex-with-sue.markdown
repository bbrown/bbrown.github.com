<br /><a href="/values/people/sandibrown.cfm">Sandi</a> and I have been watching <a href="http://www.talksexwithsue.com/">Talk Sex with Sue Johanson</a> lately. No, we're not looking to get into any perversions. It's just a call-in show about sexuality hosted by an old lady who could be anyone's grandmother. I know <a href="">Dr. Ruth</a> was old and all, but she didn't look that old and I don't recall her discussing some of the things that Sue talks about.<br /><br />There's just something fascinating about watching an old lady discuss the best in butt plugs and vibrators. I mean that in the least kinky way you can imagine. Old people are definitely not sexy&#x2014;though my views on the subject will certain change when I become old.<br /><br /><br />

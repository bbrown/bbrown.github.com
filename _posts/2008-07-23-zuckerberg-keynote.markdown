<p>
Here are my notes on the Zuckerberg keynote.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Start: boring.</li>
<li>Important to have a purpose behind the mission of the movement. *snore*</li>
<li>He calls it a "vacation" but he's describing a "vision quest."</li>
<li>An hour and a half of this. Uh oh.</li>
<li>
"Mission: Give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected"
</li>
<li>90 million people are on Facebook as of July 23rd</li>
<li>32% US, 68% international</li>
<li>Opening up the translation tools to application developers!!</li>
<li>400,000 developers</li>
<li>Billion dollar ecosystem surrounding Facebook, if VC equaled real money</li>
<li>"Virtuous cycle of sharing" around feeds</li>
<li>iLike primarily spread and shared through feeds</li>
<li>
Lessons learned from the last year: a) listen to developers more; b) build the right tools; c) need to reward good citizens and punish the bad behavers; d) simplicity and scale are important for sharing
</li>
<li>Goals of next evolution: a) give people more powerful tools to share; b) Reward applications that help people share; c) Make things simpler</li>
<li>Feed sharing is contingent on enabling sharing</li>
<li>The new sharing paradigm will enable apps to allow friends to post stories to friends feeds</li>
<li>Showed the Bill O'Reilly Flips Out video</li>
<li>Demoed the new profile&#x2014;without a hitch.</li>
<li>He thinks decentralization is the future. It sounds like using the Facebook API as a glue, which sounds like even less monetizable to my ears.</li>
<li>Facebook Connect is the product behind that vision</li>
<li>Goals of Connect: a) build the same kinds of apps across the Web; b) share information across the Web; c) Control your information across the Web</li>
<li>Facebook Connect demo time: Digg's up first</li>
<li>Digg's going to use Facebook as OpenId, essentially&#x2014;an authentication source</li>
<li>Six Apart's up: MT plugin to integrate FB with comments, also auth source, publish it onto your feed using Publisher.</li>
<li>Citysearch demo: see friends' reviews, publish reviews to profile</li>
<li>Profile launched Monday, switchover over a period of time</li>
<li>Facebook Connect API keys available today, beta soon</li>
</ul>

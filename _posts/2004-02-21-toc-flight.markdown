<br />Things aren't looking up for <a href="http://www.objectivistcenter.org/">The Objectivist Center</a>. As <a href="http://www.noumenalself.com/archives/000034.html">noted</a> by <a href="http://www.noumenalself.com/">Noumenal Self</a>, they're suffering from a budget crunch and general lack of interest in what they're selling.<br /><br />More interesting is <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/">Diana Mertz-Hsieh</a>'s recent public <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/2004_02_15_weekly.html#107730959523309327">repudiation</a> of TOC on philosophic grounds. She lays out her objections with specific examples that illustrate the repulsive turns that organization has taken.<br /><br />Kudos to her and I look forward to the end of that divisive, dishonest institute!<br /><br /><br />

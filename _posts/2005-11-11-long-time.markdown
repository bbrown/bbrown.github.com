<br />Wow, I was just looking on eBay and I discovered that I've been a member since <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981206165210/http://www2.ebay.com/index.html">December 6, 1998</a>. Curious about some other sites that I'm a member of, I found that I joined <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">MetaFilter</a> on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000706195649/http://www.metafilter.com/">June 6, 2000</a>, used <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> since <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001119075200/www.blogger.com/">March 2000</a>, and placed my first order at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> on <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/content/amazon_tabs98.jpg">August 17, 1998</a>. I'm just saying.<br /><br />Another blast from the past: here's what my site <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010513204432/http://www.public.asu.edu/~bbrown/">looked like in May 2001</a>. I had had the site for perhaps two or three years prior to that, but it apparently didn't rank enough for Archive.org to index it. I guess it's pretty clear that I love the colors blue and yellow together.<br /><br /><br />

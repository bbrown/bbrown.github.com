<br />I've been trying to post more lately, but they've been pretty brief posts because I'm knee deep in a project at work. "Knee deep" means 50-60 hours a week. I really, really want to write longer entries but they'll have to wait until this project is over. It'll be so nice to have weekends off again.<br /><br /><br />

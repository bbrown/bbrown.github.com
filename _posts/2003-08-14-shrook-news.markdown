<br />There's a new <a href="http://www.fondantfancies.com/shrook/shrook-1.2.dmg">version</a> of <a href="http://www.fondantfancies.com/shrook/">Shrook</a> available. 1.2 adds searching, synchronization, and performance enhancements (yay to that one!). I think it's <acronym title="User Interface">UI</acronym> is better than <a href="http://www.fondantfancies.com/shrook/shrook-1.2.dmg">NetNewsWire</a>'s, but that's just me. I actually paid the $19.95 to register it, that's how good it is. I'll update later with anything special I notice about the new version.<br /><br /><br />

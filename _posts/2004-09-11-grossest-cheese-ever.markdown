<br />I was sweeping around my kitchen, when I noticed a little yellow something in the crevice between my refrigerator and countertop. I swept it out and it looked like a piece of yellow plastic&#x2014;maybe a piece of a toy.<br /><br />Then I realized that I was holding a piece of petrified Kraft single-slice cheese! I thought about taking a picture, but pictures really couldn't do it tactile justice. It felt a little slimy; it had a slight greasy film even though it was rock solid. It broke in the most interesting fashion.<br /><br />I don't know how long it was there and I'm not sure if I could duplicate the conditions without throwing a piece of cheese down there. If you're so inclined, I would highly recommend it.<br /><br /><br />

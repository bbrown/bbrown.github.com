"To have the freedom to succeed, we must preserve the freedom to fail. Any solution to our present crisis must preserve our essential economic freedom. Congress should delay consideration of any legislation until the facts and competing solutions can be fully debated, consider alternatives to massive government spending and figure out how to pay for the solution through budget cuts and reform instead of more debt or taxes." &#x2014; Mike Pence (R-Indiana), <a href="http://mikepence.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=103096">"Pence Opposes Bush Administration Bailout Plan"</a>

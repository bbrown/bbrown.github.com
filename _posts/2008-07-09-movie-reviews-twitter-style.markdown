Here's the latest installment of my quick reviews, slightly larger than normal because I had forgotten to do this sooner. For a change, let's limit the review to a maximum of 140 characters&#x2014;<a href="http://twitter.com/billbrown/">&#xE0; la Twitter</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000OPOANO/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Duck, You Sucker</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Duck_You_Sucker/70074612">Netflix</a>): Proof that even Sergio Leone made stinkers. I wouldn't have thought so had I not seen this. Absolute waste of James Coburn.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000OVLBGC/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>The Lives of Others</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The_Lives_of_Others/70056425">Netflix</a>): Absolutely great movie about the corrupting influence of the Stasi, for both the people and the Stasi themselves. Five stars, two thumbs up.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AY6SB6/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Tom Green: Inside &amp; Outside the Box</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Tom_Green_Inside_Outside_the_Box_Disc_1/70037705">Netflix</a>): Do not consume too much in one sitting. It will seriously distort your perspective. If you don't already like Tom Green, sit this one out.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JH9C/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Sullivan's Travels</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Sullivan_s_Travels/60020701">Netflix</a>): Hokey 40s movie about whiny director who wants to get in touch with the common man. Best part: reminded me how far we've come in movies.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0010DR4BO/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The_Assassination_of_Jesse_James_by_the_Coward_Robert_Ford/70044698">Netflix</a>): Rambling, dawdling, meandering, and self-important epic that concentrates too much on Jesse James as folk hero and Robert Ford as idolator.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000OT6V0K/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>The Siege</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The_Siege/18114876">Netflix</a>): FBI can't stop terrorism. Army seals off Manhattan and imposes martial law. This is how Hollywood views us: chomping to intern them Muslims.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0017XOF50/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>The Onion Movie</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The_Onion_Movie/70096931">Netflix</a>): The Onion cashes out. Watch the podcast, it's better. This generation's Kentucky Fried Movie? Perhaps. Best part: <a href="http://xrl.us/Cockpuncher">http://xrl.us/Cockpuncher</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000YAF4MA/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>The Bucket List</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The_Bucket_List/70077542">Netflix</a>): Damn it, you made me enjoy Jack Nicholson. Maudlin but mesmerizing. Sappy but sentimental. Ending is dreadfully, utterly predictable.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0011KQSZ4/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Death at a Funeral</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Death_at_a_Funeral/70058015">Netflix</a>): At funeral, kids find out dad was having an affair with a midget, who wants money to keep quiet but gets killed. You-know-what ensues.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008R9KF/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>My Beautiful Laundrette</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/My_Beautiful_Laundrette/60010689">Netflix</a>): Ambitious guy steals drug money to renovate laundromat. Hires school chum turned tough. Screws same in back room. Why did I rent this?
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLIB/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Mad About You: Season 1</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Mad_About_You_Season_1_Disc_1/60024903">Netflix</a>): This is the reason why Helen Hunt was on my list for so long (and why I own Twister). Mercifully M.A.B.E.L.-free.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000EWJP64/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Duck Soup</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Duck_Soup/60029364">Netflix</a>): "Marx Brothers at their sidesplitting best." I'd hate to see their worst. Making fun of Hitler shouldn't be this bad. Couldn't finish.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00002E23C/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Pacific Heights</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Pacific_Heights/838117">Netflix</a>): Michael Keaton rocks as a creepy renter who just won't leave. Good subplot involves oppressive San Francisco government and cost of housing.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/B000F4LPJ6/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Battle Royale</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Battle_Royale/70004548">Netflix</a>): Japanese bad kids dropped on island with weapons and only one can survive. I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true story, which it isn't.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007TKNGU/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>The Americanization of Emily</cite></a> (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The_Americanization_of_Emily/60011005">Netflix</a>): James Garner and Julie Andrews. That was enough for me, but the wacky plot kept it interesting and the anti-war rant wasn't overblown.
</li>
</ul>

Inspired by <a href="http://www.dirtdon.com/?p=886">this helpful post</a> about <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, I thought I'd share a quick and easy way to shorten a URL with <a href="http://app.x.co/">X.CO</a> using Alfred.
</p>
<p>
First thing you'll need is your API key, which can be found on the <a href="http://app.x.co/Setting.aspx">Settings</a> page.
</p>
<p>
Once you have that, you just need to fill in the Terminal Shortcut like so:
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://bbrown.info//shorten-then-copy.png" alt="Alfred Settings for the X.CO integration" border="0" width="584" height="345" />
</p>
<p>
That "Command" field reads (replace KEY with the API key you copied previously): <code>curl -s http://api.x.co/Squeeze.svc/text/KEY?url={query} | pbcopy</code>
</p>
<p>
Hit "Save," make it "Silent" by checking that box, and you're ready to shorten. To use it, invoke Alfred, type "x http://your-url-to-shorten.com/", and press Return. Your clipboard will contain the shortened URL.
</p>
<p>
Another option that works really well is to create a Terminal Shortcut mapped to "xc" that runs the Command "<code>curl -s http://api.x.co/Squeeze.svc/text/KEY?url=$(pbpaste) | pbcopy</code>". This version will pull the source URL from your clipboard, shorten it, and replace it on the clipboard with the shortened form. That is very handy.

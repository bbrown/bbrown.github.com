My time on <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/blog/landing.asp">Quick Blogcast</a> is now waning! A couple weeks ago, I voiced my readiness for a change in scenery to my boss and his boss, giving them a short list of products that I wouldn't mind working on. (I was never interested in leaving Go Daddy, so a move to a different company was out of the question.) My first choice—sorry, no details—wasn't available since the main development team was based out of Iowa. Today I found out that I got my second choice: Forums! (Some of you in the know are probably wondering if I'm grooming myself for a job at <a href="http://www.telligent.com/">Telligent</a>. Nuh uh.)
</p>
<p>
Let me start by explaining why I wanted a change. It's not because of my team or the direction of the product. I started Quick Blog two weeks after <a href="http://bbrown.info/2005/05/10/first-day-at-go-daddy-2.aspx">joining Go Daddy in May 2005</a>. I wrote up the vision document, drafted the requirements document, and even created the first prototype for the layout. It wasn't until about a month or two later that I had a co-worker. For the next two years, I was the rock that kept Quick Blog going as team members drifted in and out. As a blogger, I felt a real kinship with the product and I just loved it to death: when I was considering a personalized license plate earlier this year, I almost picked "QCKBLOG."
</p>
<p>
That dedication was well-regarded but it took a toll. I was just working myself too hard, identifying too much with my product. After two years of countless weekends and weeks of 60, 70, even 80 hours, I was spent. It's not that I was neglecting my family—there was no "Cats in the Cradle" at play—but I certainly wasn't giving them my full attention.
</p>
<p>
I'm really excited to work on Forums. I'm an avid user of them and I'd like to see if my heretofore success with 1.0 products is replicable coming in to an existing product. I certainly prefer the 1.0s but I'm up for any change at this point.

[UPDATE (8/27/2007): Sadly, the guy on the other team is in the middle of a big release so I have to stay on through the end of September. It's not that I hate my current team or anything; I just was excited to start on a new adventure and waiting a month and a half is interminable for that.]

<br />I'm sorry about the lack of updates the last few days. I've got three things I've wanted to review<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068DBC/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Pulp Fiction</cite></a> (hated), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670899240/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Getting Things Done</cite></a> (loved), and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740718584/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>The Millionaire Mind</cite></a> (mixed)&#x2014;but with the amount of sleep I've gotten since <a href="/gallery/kimberly/">Kimberly</a> came on the scene, I was afraid of how bad the reviews might turn out. The best I can do is throw out a couple of <a href="/blogs/found/">Found on the Web</a> blog entries&#x2014;short and sweet links.<br /><br />Today is the day where I might get enough sleep. If so, then I'll probably have a review come out. Or time to surf around. Thanks for your patience.<br /><br /><br />

<br /><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/01/25/iraq/main668963.shtml">"$80 Billion for War in '05"</a>: among the tidbits in this story is that the new American embassy in Baghdad will cost at least $1.5 billion. I say "at least" because cost projections that large <a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/TCS/wastebasket/transportation/4-12-00.htm">inevitably</a> run over. (Side note: the projected cost of the Iraqi War could run to $1.5 trillion. That's more than freaking World War II.)<br /><br />This is exactly the sort of thing that I hate about George W. Bush. Time was, conservatives were religious zealots but you knew that the size of the budget wouldn't blossom too much. With a <em>projected</em> budget deficit of <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/world/10736775.htm?1c">$427 billion</a>, Bush is showing the tax-and-spenders a thing or two.<br /><br />The good news is that he can't run in 2008, so there's an end in sight. Unfortunately, I have no idea what Republican would take his place: McCain is fiscally conservative but more pragmatic than I would like and Schwarzenegger is foreign-born. This rampant spending, though, has to be curbed.<br /><br /><br />

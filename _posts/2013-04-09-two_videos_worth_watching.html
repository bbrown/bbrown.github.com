Reading through <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5511466" title="Hacker News has a high signal-to-noise ratio.">this Hacker News thread</a>, I came across dozens of great talks to check out in the future. So far I've watched two and I think they're worth sharing:
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat" title="I always imagined it pronounced like 'wut' rather than 'waat' but I'm not sure either is definitive.">Wat</a>: it's practically programming standup, poking fun at some of the "quirks" of Ruby and JavaScript. Plus it's four minutes long, shorter than an Ignite talk.</li>
<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366" title="I've got to figure out my principle.">Inventing on Principle</a>: this one's longer at 54 minutes but so incredibly inspiring. It's a talk about life in the guise of a reconception of human-computer interaction. After watching it, I immediately started following him <a href="https://twitter.com/worrydream" title="With 233 tweets, I think I can read through all of them pretty quickly.">on Twitter</a> and checked out his <a href="http://www.worrydream.com/" title="Look at how incredibly prolific this guy is! WOW!">amazing Web site</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If there are any awesome talks you'd like to share, I'm very interested and my email address is over in the right side bar.

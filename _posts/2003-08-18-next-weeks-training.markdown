<br />I just found out who will conduct next week's .NET training from <a href="http://www.developmentor.com/">DevelopMentor</a>: <a href="">Kevin Brown</a>, <a href="http://staff.develop.com/woodring/">Mike Woodring</a>, <a href="http://staff.develop.com/onion/">Fritz Onion</a>, and <a href="http://staff.develop.com/jasonw/weblog/">Jason Whittington</a>. Looks like a good team; I can't wait till next week.<br /><br /><br />

<br /><ul><li>I got some change back from my usual Rooster Booster Lite refill at QuikTrip and in it was the <a href="http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/index.cfm?flash=yes&amp;action=nickel_series">new nickel</a>. That is one beautiful coin. I'm glad that they went with the <a href="http://www.monticello.org/gallery/jefferson/houdon.html">Houdon sculpture</a>, which I've always loved. The buffalo on the back is even neat: it's a great nod to the nickel's history.</li><li>The portion of the Loop 101 that runs through Scottsdale has a reputation for being perilous. I never really believed it, but that was because my excursions into the Scottsdale portion were either short (to Scottsdale Road) or infrequent (like trips to Scottsdale Healthcare Shea). I believe it now that I was almost run off the road by someone who proceeded to make at least a dozen more lane changes before I lost sight. Inspired perhaps by this maniac, three other vehicles decided to do the exact same thing. Lots of heads were shaking.</li></ul><br /><br /><br />

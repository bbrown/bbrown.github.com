<br />As a general rule, I can't stand project managers. In my profession (web development), they are totally irrelevant&#x2014;the last bastions for deposed managers. <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/">Edward Tufte</a>, famed information depicter, has an <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/1906511601/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?usca_p=t&amp;msg_id=000076&amp;topic_id=1&amp;topic=Ask%20E%2eT%2e">interesting thread</a> about their stock in trade, the <a href="http://www.smartdraw.com/resources/examples/business/gantt.htm">Gantt chart</a>. It's basically a way to depict project tasks and dependencies. If that means nothing to you, imagine a to-do list that spans a work team and includes time estimates.<br /><br />Oops, I may have given away too much there. Let me try again: it leverages the power of information design to illustrate the cross-team interdependencies in a given project and facilitates rapid information conveyance through a paradigmatic convention. Now I'm <a href="http://www.pmi.org/certification/">PMPin</a>'.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I don't think they should all be lined up and shot. I'm sure there's some situation in which they're the most efficient means to managing a project; I'm just saying that I've never encountered that situation.<br /><br /><br />

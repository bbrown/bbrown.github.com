<br />We're watching a program on <a href="http://health.discovery.com/">Discovery Health</a> about the use of maggots in healing wounds. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1907065.stm">Apparently</a>, their use is becoming more prevalent in the United Kingdom. I can't really disparage it too much since it's <a href="http://tampabay.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2001/05/21/focus1.html">doing the job</a> well, but it's rather disconcerting to see a doctor lift up a bandage on a lady's foot and see maggots crawling all over the wound.<br /><br />For those of you whose jaws still haven't closed, the maggots are completely sterile and grown in a laboratory. The theory is that their ability to eat infectious bacteria far exceeds our ability to kill them. The lady in question said that she didn't feel a thing and the doctors say that it's miraculous at preventing gangrene.<br /><br /><br />

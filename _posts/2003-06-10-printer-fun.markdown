<br />Upon the advice of these <a href="http://www.zug.com/pranks/ideas/computer.html">computer pranks</a>, I played around with the printer at work&#x2014;an <acronym title="Hewlett-Packard">HP</acronym> LaserJet 4000M&#x2014;and changed the default "READY" message on the front <acronym title="Liquid Crystal Display">LCD</acronym> to "PC LOAD LETTER." If you're not familiar with that message, please watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305508550/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Office Space</cite></a> repeatedly until you get it. If you want to repeat my trick, I'll have to tell you how to do it because the prank doesn't go into near enough detail.<br /><br />Other thoughts for the message:<ul><li>"BOW BEFORE ME, HEATHEN!"</li><li>"PAPER SIZE DOESN'T MATTER"</li><li>"OFFLINE"</li><li>"ALMOST READY"</li><li>"WARMING UP"</li><li>"HAVE A NICE DAY!"</li><li>"PLEASE WASH HANDS BEFORE TOUCHING ME"</li></ul><br /><br />If you have any other ideas, please leave them in the comments.<br /><br /><br />

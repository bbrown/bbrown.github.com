This article on <a href="http://laserlike.com/2008/09/02/cargo-cult-management/">cargo cult management</a> really struck me. I can't say that I've seen much of that sort of thing at Go Daddy&#x2014;that's the part where Go Daddy is more startup than big business&#x2014;but I've definitely seen that theme running throughout the business and management literature. Mike Speiser also nailed the identification of Jim Collins' bilge, which I had always considered spurious but couldn't name what bothered me so much about his approach. Now I've got a formulation to use when I see this sort of activity.

Next to Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson is perhaps the most revered man
in American history. He was an inventor, statesman, architect, lawyer,
farmer, political theorist, prolific writer, governor of Virginia,
Secretary of State, Vice-President, and President. He was the conscience
of the Revolution, never failing to expound on the natural and inherent
rights of man and any infringement thereof. He helped to put Lockean
political philosophy into an American context and, without this
achievement, the American Revolution would never have happened. In his
honor, monuments have been erected and cities have born his surname. So it
has been until the twentieth century. We live in a peculiar era, one that
seemingly detests greatness. Whenever a titan of American history is
venerated, someone recalls an unsupported smear or any faults he may have
had. For instance, when you speak of Christopher Columbus, someone
indubitably brings up the diseases he brought with him or the fact that he
was lost at sea a great deal of his voyage. Or: that Ulysses S. Grant was
a drunkard. Or: George Washington was aristocratic. Or: Franklin Roosevelt
was a womanizer who knew of the Pearl Harbor ambush, but did nothing about
it. There are some who cannot practice hero-worship and believe that
everyone is black at heart. To be sure, this is an ancient tradition, but
it was never as insidious as it is today. Even Thomas Jefferson is not
immune. If you even mention Thomas Jefferson's name, someone inevitably
brings up his apparently hypocritical holding of over one hundred slaves.
And they accuse him of holding one of his slaves, Sally Hemings, as his
mistress. Ayn Rand, a novelist-philosopher, described this whole
phenomenon&mdash;the desire to topple heroes, to endow them with feet of
clay&mdash;as "hatred of the good for being the good." My purpose, in
writing this research paper, is just the opposite: I want to show that
Thomas Jefferson, far from being the hypocrite his detractors allege, was
actually a serious and ardent defender of the emancipation of slaves,
<em>i.e.</em>, an abolitionist. It is important for people to have role
models&mdash;individuals whose virtues they may emulate. I believe Thomas
Jefferson, the paragon of reason, is just such a person.
</p>
<p>
Upon his election to the Virginia House of Burgesses, Jefferson wasted
little time in establishing himself as an opponent of slavery. Being a
timid freshman, he persuaded Richard Bland to introduce a piece of
legislation that he would second which would allow individual slave
holders to free their slaves by will or affidavit, provided they would not
become public charges. Prior to this, slave owners could only free their
slaves by a petition to the governor and Privy Council and then only
because of the slave's good service. The bill was rejected, but was passed
in 1782.<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a> In that same year, Jefferson
signed the Virginia House of Burgesses' recommendation to those who would
form Associations of non-intercourse with England that "they will not
import any slaves, or purchase any imported, after the first day of
November next, until the said acts are repealed."<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a>
In 1772, the House of Burgesses petitioned King George after a legislative
act restricting slave importation had been struck down by the Royal Privy
Council: "The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of
Africa hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity, and under
its present encouragement, we have too much reason to fear will endanger
the very existence of your Majesty's American dominions&hellip;. Deeply
impressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech your Majesty to
remove all those restraints on your Majesty's governors of this colony,
which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very
pernicious a commerce."<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a> Finally, in
1778, the Virginia legislature passed a measure abolishing the slave trade
outright, in part through the efforts of Jefferson. However successful,
eventually, were his efforts to end the slave trade, Jefferson was
continually frustrated by the inaction of his fellow Virginians. After
publicly supporting the rights of man and the evils of slavery, they were
strangely silent when legislation was on the table.
</p>
<p>
Jefferson's stance in the House of Burgesses was but a prelude to the
attacks on slavery contained in his original drafts of the Declaration of
Independence. The Declaration of Independence that we are able to read is
actually the product of three revisions: one by Benjamin Franklin and John
Adams, one by the Committee of Five, and the final revision by the
Committee of the Whole (the Continental Congress). By the final draft,
this indictment of King George for his promotion of slavery had been
stricken:
</p>
<blockquote>
"he has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it's most
sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of distant people who
never offended him, captivating &amp; carrying them into slavery in
another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation
thither. this piratical warfare, the opprobrium of <em>infidel</em>
powers, is the warfare of the CHRISTIAN king of Great Britain. determined
to keep open a market where MEN should be bought &amp; sold, he has
prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to
prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce: and that this assemblage
of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting
those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty
of which <em>he</em> has deprived them, by murdering the people upon whom
<em>he</em> also obtruded them; thus paying off former crimes committed
against the <em>liberties</em> of one people, with crimes which he urges
them to commit against the <em>lives</em> of another."<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
One of Thomas Jefferson's most important and controversial contributions
to the cause of anti-slavery was his involvement in the Ordinance of 1784.
This historic piece of legislation, put forth in the Congress under the
Articles of Confederation, was drafted to establish the procedures for
statehood and territory status for the massive amounts of land ceded to
the Continental Congress by the various states and Great Britain.
Jefferson's proposal abolished all forms of slavery and involuntary
servitude in these lands. This was a bold move, since the southern
portions of this territory had not yet been ceded to the fledgling
government at that time and there was no justification for such a move in
the Articles of Confederation. Jefferson reasoned that the power to
exclude slavery was a national concern, not a local one. Further
frustrating Jefferson's efforts, this act failed enaction by one vote! The
delegate from New Jersey was violently ill the day of the vote and thus
could not affirm slavery's prohibition in the new territories. As
Jefferson later wrote, "Thus we see the fate of millions unborn hanging on
the tongue of one man, and heaven was silent in that awful moment."<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a>
Jefferson's ideas, in diluted form, were later incorporated into the
Northwest Ordinance of 1787.
</p>
<p>
As President during his second term, Thomas Jefferson introduced
legislation tellingly entitled, "Act to prohibit the importation of Slaves
into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States, from
and after the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and eight." This act made it a crime to transport any slave
to an American territory. It did not prohibit slavery <em>per se</em>, but
at least the act stopped its proliferation.
</p>
<p>
Thomas Jefferson believed that a political campaign was the best way to
wage the abolitionist battle, but, as is shown by the campaign's results,
it was not the best way. The political reforms he proposed were both
widely denounced and largely ignored. The fact is, that when it came to
his crucial documents, like the Declaration of Independence and the
Ordinance of 1784, the slave owners saw to it that any anti-slavery
language was removed from the final product. The only possible route to
abolition was through a philosophical, and consequently, cultural change.
Abraham Lincoln could never have emancipated the slaves without a strong,
fervent abolitionist movement that permeated all sectors of the culture.
Thomas Jefferson did not have that luxury. However, several of his
published works formed a stepping stone for the later movement and that
movement would not have existed without his (and others) early
foundation-building.
</p>
<p>
<cite>A Summary View of the Rights of British America</cite> was a set of
instructions for Virginia's delegates to the proposed first Congress of
the Colonies. It was rejected, but published by Jefferson's admirers
anonymously. In it, Jefferson accused King George of much the same charges
he lobbed in the Declaration of Independence. He added another this way,
"Thus preferring the immediate advantages of a few British corsairs, to
the lasting interests of the American States, and to the rights of human
nature, deeply wounded by this infamous practice." He furthers writes of
the colonists attempts at cessation of the slave trade and the King's
subsequent vetoes. This document established Jefferson as an eminent
writer of philosophic discourse, setting him up for the authorship of the
Declaration of Independence.
</p>
<p>
In Jefferson's <cite>Notes on Virginia</cite>, we find his most lengthy
treatment of the subject of slavery. We also find his most startling, in
the twentieth century context, views on the nature of blacks, whites, and
their intermingling. <cite>Notes on Virginia</cite> was an address to a
Frenchman, who had never set foot in Virginia and was curious about the
Old Dominion. In it, he answered queries regarding Virginia's government,
land, customs, educational system, towns, and wildlife. In Query XIV, on
the administration of justice and Virginia's laws, Jefferson discusses the
great reform of Virginia's laws taken on by the General Assembly following
the Revolutionary War. One of the reform measures was the emancipation of
all slaves born after passage of the act. The plan boldly asserts that the
newly freed children should remain with their parents until a certain age
and then be educated, at public expense, in a field appropriate (farming,
science, or arts) to them until the age of eighteen or twenty-one, females
and males respectively. At that time, Jefferson would have them shipped
off to some destination most proper, fully supplied with all the
essentials to found a new colony. Then, ships would be sent off to bring
back an equal number of white settlers from some other land and induce
them to settle in Virginia. This seems mighty odd, when compared with what
we know and have seen of Jefferson. As usual, he continues on in answer to
this seeming contradiction. He states that the blacks should not live
among the whites because of the racial prejudices of the whites and the
resentfulness bred by the injustices the blacks had suffered&mdash;it was
not fair to the blacks. Given the context of the times, this was a wholly
logical and reasonable prescription. After this fairly rational argument,
Jefferson lapses into a polemic about the perils of miscegenation: "When
freed, he is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture&hellip;"<a href="#6" class="footnote">6</a>
and "&hellip;their own judgment in favor of the whites, declared by their
preference of them, as uniformly as is the preference of the Oran[g]utan
for the black woman over those of his own species."<a href="#7" class="footnote">7</a>
Both of these statements paint a different picture than what the rest of
my paper has portrayed, but I think that we must keep in mind the context:
Jefferson was a Virginia plantation owner in the late eighteenth century.
It was very common for white men to speculate about the nature of the
blacks, since they had no scientific basis for anything to the contrary.
While I would certainly deplore these views, I would have to say that
Jefferson honestly knew no better.
</p>
<p>
The final aspect to consider is the charges of miscegenation with his
slave-girl, Sally Hemings. First we must consider how the reports
originally surfaced. In the Campaign of 1800, a young man by the name of
James Callender, a Jeffersonian Democrat employed in the art of Federalist
character assassination, dutifully served the factional needs of Jefferson
the politician. He thought that he should be compensated for his efforts
with an appointment to Postmaster of Richmond, Virginia. Jefferson
refused. Soon after, Callender dug up evidence of mulatto children at
Monticello and interviewed one of the Hemings slaves. He printed all this
in a story in a Federalist newspaper. There it died, after a brief
political life, until Fawn Brodie resurrected it in 1973 for her
psychohistorical biography entitled <cite>Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate
History</cite>. The story goes as follows: while Jefferson was in Paris,
he sent for his daughter, Mary, who was accompanied on the trip by Sally
Hemings, a young slave lass of twelve. Soon thereafter, he began making
advances towards her. She wanted to remain in France and be free, but this
Casanova would not have that. He promised her that any children they had
would be freed upon adulthood. After leaving France, Jefferson used Sally
Hemings as his chambermaid at Monticello. He continued being intimate with
her even after it was revealed by James Callender. In fact, he risked his
Presidency during both terms by having sexual relations with this
pubescent. While this story has captured the fancy of the American public,
it has thoroughly been discredited by all Jefferson and American History
scholars as sheer folly. First, given Jefferson's strong and consistent
views on miscegenation, it is highly unlikely that he sired children by
Sally Hemings, much less had sexual intercourse with her. Second, none of
the other residents of Monticello ever suspected a thing. He had three
daughters living with him twenty-four hours a day, as well as frequent and
numerous guests. That none of them ever suspected him of cavorting with
Sally should mean a lot. Third, there is plentiful evidence that
Jefferson's nephews, Peter and Samuel Carr, were wholly responsible for
the mulatto children of Monticello. In fact, Ellen Randolph Coolidge,
Jefferson's granddaughter who grew up at Monticello, called Samuel Carr
"the most notorious good-natured Turk that ever was master of a black
seraglio kept at other men's expense."<a href="#8" class="footnote">8</a>
It is absurd to contend that Thomas Jefferson would betray the moral
teachings he prescribed for his relatives, friends, and himself, without
any positive evidence for support. If we are to judge Jefferson, it must
be on the basis of the standards he set for himself, the philosophy he
explicitly advocated, and the actions he performed over the course of his
lifetime. He was completely consistent in every facet of his being and
because of that, we must dismiss any charges levied against him.

<p>
In researching this essay, I deliberately left out any reference to Thomas
Jefferson's correspondence. In all, he penned over fifty thousand letters
to all sorts of people. To read them all and comment on them would be
beyond the scope of a research paper. It would require a book-length
treatment, at least. I focused my research on primary documents, since
these came from the mind of Jefferson himself. Where better to learn about
the man behind the myth then to explore his most personal beliefs.
However, I could not have done anything without the assistance of <cite>The
Wolf by the Ears: Thomas Jefferson and Slavery</cite> by John Chester
Miller. This book surveys the whole of Jefferson's life and deals with the
conflicts Jefferson had between his racial and liberal views.
</p>
<p>
The brevity of a prospectus does not lend itself well to painting the full
picture of Thomas Jefferson <em>qua</em> abolitionist, but the sketches I
have drawn here should indicate the boundaries and the highlights. The
Founding Fathers, insofar as they practiced what they preached, deserve
the utmost respect and honor. The defamation of their characters by
unsupported allegations hurled from the distance of two centuries is
repulsive. Few people have <em>no</em> faults, but that is not why the
Founding Fathers are important. They are to be lauded for their virtues,
their achievements.

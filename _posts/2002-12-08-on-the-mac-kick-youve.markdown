<br />On the Mac kick, you've probably all seen the company's <a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/">Switchers</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/ads/" title="Ellen Feiss is an Internet phenomenon.">campaign</a>. In true Mac fanatic style, there's been dozens of parodies of the ads featuring <a href="http://download.theforce.net/humor/soloswitch.mov" title="I've seen Harrison Ford and you are no Harrison Ford.">Han Solo</a>, a <a href="http://www.burdell.org/switch/monkeyswitch.mov" title="Hilarious in its utter bizarreness">monkey</a>, a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/magicshow/.Movies/switch.mov" title="Every Windows user can relate.">baby</a>, <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/keyframes/iMovieTheater1.html">Legos</a>, a <a href="http://www.ugo.com/channels/games/features/switch/" title="Skewering Mac's dearth of games (which is slowly changing)">gamer</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/ads/will/will_santa_lawyer.html" title="Santa gets his ass handed to him.">Will</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/ads/will/will_santa_ipod.html" title="Santa apparently likes the Doobie Brothers.">Ferrell</a> (<a href="http://technojunkie.org/berniec/ferrell_switch.html" title="Presented at a MacWorld Expo by Apple itself.">porn actor</a>), and <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/reviews/Framework.cfm?page=/hardwareandnews/switchparodies.html">many more</a>.<br /><br />This is really a testament to <a href="http://www.apple.com/imovie/">iMovie</a>, Apple's digital video editing software bundled with every Mac and freely downloadable off the Web.<br /><br /><br />

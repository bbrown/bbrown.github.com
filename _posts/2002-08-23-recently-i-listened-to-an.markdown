<br />Recently, I listened to an audio book version of Dave Barry's <cite>Dave Berry is Not Taking This Standing Up</cite>. It reminded me why I stopped reading <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/" title="His Miami Herald home">his column</a>: his humor is entirely based on fantasy and misrepresenting reality.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with Dave Barry, he writes about real things but makes up so many of the details that he <strong>must</strong> insert "And I'm not making this up" whenever he presents a fact. What's more, the details that he makes up are not subtle.<br /><br />To a younger or superficial reader, this is funny stuff. I am now neither and I find his columns formulaic and reliant on "humor crutches." I can read one occasionally and even occasionally laugh, but I will never sit through six compact discs worth of his dreck. The speaker, though, did an amazing job of reading&#x2014;one of the few positives about the many-weeks-of-commute-time experience.<br /><br /><br />

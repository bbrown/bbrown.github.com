<br /><a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> just posted the <a href="http://www.apple.com/hardware/ads/g5/">commercial</a> for their new <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/" title="Sweet computer, I'll say!">PowerMac G5</a> and I have to agree with <a href="http://www.appleturns.com/">As the Apple Turns</a>'s humorous <a href="http://www.appleturns.com/scene/?id=4080">take</a> on this one. It seems like a weird commercial. I get the "blown away" reference, but why was it necessary to make the guy through four or five walls and then thud against a tree.<br /><br />It harkens back to the Memorex commercial (or was it RCA?) of yore where a man is listening to his stereo on a comfy chair, his hair, tie, and expression suggesting that he was in a wind tunnel. That was an effective commercial without all the violence.<br /><br />[UPDATE (7/29/03): <a href="http://www.billpalmer.net/">Bill Palmer</a>, essayist and educator, obviously <a href="http://www.billpalmer.net/#com000007">understood</a> the subtleties of this particular ad way better than I did. Interesting take on the subject&#x2014;I'm sure the pacing of the ad was intentional.]<br /><br /><br />

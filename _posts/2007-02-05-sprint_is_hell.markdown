Whatever you do, I would advise you not to use <a href="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</a> for your cellular needs. I started a contract with them in May 2005 and they have been nothing but a headache for me ever since. At every opportunity, they have failed basic tenets of customer service. I know there are complaints about every carrier out there, but <a href="http://www.verizon.com/">Verizon</a>'s been pretty good to me so far and Sprint's behavior has been below and beyond every other one I've had the displeasure to deal with.
</p>
<p>
Our story begins in August 2006. Reception on Sprint's network was always spotty. My wife and I had both experienced innumerable instances of dropped calls, lack of service, and poor call quality. Within my house, there were definite areas that you couldn't make calls from and I had often spent time on calls in the backyard. What I didn't know was that reception in my bedroom suffered from this same basic patchiness.

<p>
In my duties, I am often on call for server problems and what have you. On that fateful night in August, I got a call from our network guys and took care of it. I placed my phone on my night stand instead of up on the dresser where I had it previously. I wrongly assumed that keeping it closer to my head would make it easier to hear. Unfortunately, my nightstand is one of the previously mentioned dead spots.
</p>
<p>
I found out the next morning that I had gotten another call from the network guys around 1 AM or so. Failing to rouse me, they called my boss, my boss's boss, the team lead, and the director of QA. Each of whom, by the way, were upset that I was unavailable. I saw the omen this portended and decided that I needed to find the most reliable network available so that this didn't happen again.

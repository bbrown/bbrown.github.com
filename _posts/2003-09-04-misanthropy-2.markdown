<br />I'm gradually losing my ability to suffer fools, tolerate boneheads, and not lash out at inanity. As you can imagine, this will probably turn out to be a career and personal liability. I can't seem to shake it.<br /><br />Any ideas how to curb this devolution or at least slow it down?<br /><br /><br />

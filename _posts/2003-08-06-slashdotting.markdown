<br />Here's my particular statistical Slashdotting:<br /><div align="center"><img src="/images/blog/analogpostslashdotting.gif" width="300" height="183" alt="Analog screen capture showing swell in traffic yesterday" style="padding:10px;" /></div><br />Can you figure out which day my review got posted on Slashdot's front page? I knew you could.<br /><br />The results are slightly skewed by some very strange activity from <a href="http://www.teoma.com/">Teoma</a> and <a href="http://www.turnitin.com/">Turnitin</a>, whose bots turned in 547 and 307 page views respectively. I have no idea why they suddenly found my pages so interesting. Also turning in high page view counts is <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> with 178. Welcome, IBMers! Keep up the good work with the <a href="http://www.apple.com/g5/">G5</a>, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>, or <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/">developerWorks</a> depending on your responsibilities.<br /><br /><br />

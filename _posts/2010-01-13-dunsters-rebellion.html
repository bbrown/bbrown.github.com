<h2>Harvard College's Distinctive Beginnings</h2>
<p>
The sailing of the Mayflower and the founding of the Massachusetts Bay
Colony were an early portent of the eventual separation of England and its
daughter colony. Though they still thought of themselves as Englishmen,
the physical distance between the two became a dividing wedge that led to
American independence. As best as they could, the citizens of New England
sought to reproduce English society in the wilderness. They named their
cities and towns using English place names. They transported English
institutions. One of the first institutions to be recreated was the
university since over 130 of the colonists were graduates of the two
English universities&mdash;Oxford and Cambridge.<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a> The Puritans believed the university to be an important device in their religious arsenal.
</p>
<p>
The General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony created Harvard College
on November 15, 1637 by the simple invocation "The colledg is ordered to
bee at Newtowne."<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a> With those eight words, the oldest university in the Western Hemisphere still in existence was founded. This
act by the General Court did not specify the college's curriculum, its
government, or even its financing. Realizing its vagueness, the General
Court soon formed a committee to oversee the formation of the college:
</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Committee as to the colledg at New Towne</em>: For the colledge, the
Governour, Mr Winthrope, the Deputy, Mr Dudley, the Treasurer, Mr
Bellingham, Mr Humfrey, Mr Herlakenden, Mr Staughton, Mr Cotton, Mr
Wilson, Mr Damport, Mr Wells, Mr Sheopard, and Mr Peters, these, or the
greater part of them, whereof Mr Winthrope, Mr Dudly, or Mr Bellingham, to
bee alway one, to take order for a colledge at Newetowne.<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
This act formed what would later come to be known as the Board of
Overseers, the body that guided Harvard's infancy. This committee
consisted of six magistrates&mdash;officials of the colony&mdash;and six
clergymen. Of the magistrates, Winthrop and Humfrey were educated at
Cambridge. Of the ministers, Davenport (listed as Damport) was educated at
Oxford and the rest matriculated from Cambridge. Thus, the group that
would guide the early stages of the founding of Harvard College was
two-thirds composed of university men. Even the remaining third had
brothers and sons who were university men.<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a> These
committeemen wanted nothing less than a recreation of their alma mater in
colonial America.
</p>
<p>
The group's only task was to "take order for a colledge at Newetowne."
However, no money had been appropriated, no charter granted, and no powers
enumerated. The gentlemen decided that the first step was to hire an
instructor. To this end, as Harvard Treasurer Thomas Danforth recorded
later, "Mr Nathaniel Eaton was chosen Professor of the sd Schoole in the
yeare One thousand six hundred thirty seaven, to whose care the management
of the Donations before mentioned were betrusted for the erecting of such
Edifices as were meet and necessary for a Colledge: and for his own
Lodgings."<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a>
</p>
<p>
This Nathaniel Eaton that was chosen to open the college was a graduate of
Cambridge and the brother of Theophilus Eaton, one of the organizers of
the Massachusetts Bay Company. Many of the committee were familiar with
him and his family and his educational background was as impressive as one
could expect in New England. Unfortunately, his first and only year at the
college was filled with scandal and rancor. He absconded with
then-significant amounts of money appropriated for the school, provided
subpar rations for the students, and, as Cotton Mather put it, "his
<em>cruelty</em> was more scandalous than his <em>avarice</em>."<a href="#6" class="footnote">6</a>
He was dismissed by the General Court on September 9, 1639: "Mr. Nathaniel
Eaton being accused for cruell and barbarous beating of Mr. Naz. Brisco,
and for other neglecting and misusing of his Scholars, it was ordered that
Mr. Eaton should be discharged from keeping School with use without
License."<a href="#7" class="footnote">7</a>
</p>
<p>
The year prior, Eaton had accepted a 'Donation' from the recently arrived
and recently deceased John Harvard. Harvard, on his death bed from
consumption, bequeathed half his estate and all of his library to the
fledgling college at Newtown, which was renamed Cambridge that same year.
To honor his generosity, the General Court "ordered, that the colledge
agreed upon formerly to bee built at Cambridg shalbee called Harvard
Colledge."<a href="#8" class="footnote">8</a> Most of the Harvard legacy
is unaccounted for, due to Eaton's financial misconduct, and the library
of 400 volumes must be considered his lasting gift to the college.
</p>
<p>
After the dismissal of Nathaniel Eaton, Harvard was closed down with no
apparent reopening. The students were dispersed into town or back home. It
seemed that the heretofore bright future of Harvard had dimmed. That is
until Henry Dunster was hired by the future Board of Overseers in 1640.
Henry Dunster was an unusual choice: he had less education than Eaton, had
not written on weighty theological issues as Eaton had, and lacked the
distinguished air of Eaton. Of course, knowing what the town had just gone
through, the choice of the schoolmasterly Dunster does not seem as odd.
</p>
<p>
Henry Dunster received his bachelor's of arts from Magdalene College,
University of Cambridge in 1631.<a href="#9" class="footnote">9</a> He
received his master's degree in 1634, ranking just 115 out of 188 students
in his class.<a href="#10" class="footnote">10</a> He became a
schoolmaster in his home town of Bury, England after receiving his
master's and emigrated to America in 1640. Within a few weeks of his
arrival in New England, a council of magistrates and elders "invited
[Dunster] to accept the Place of President of the College, which he
accordingly accepted; to whom was committed the Care and Trust of
finishing the College Buildings and his own Lodgings, and the Custody of
the College Fund, and such Donations as might further be added to the
Encrease thereof."<a href="#11" class="footnote">11</a> Dunster apparently
did not realize what was expected of him, as he later complained that they
had called on him "to undertake the instructing of the youth of riper
years and literature after they came from grammer schools&hellip;. No
further care or distraction was improsed on mee or expected from mee but
to instruct."<a href="#12" class="footnote">12</a> He would soon find out
just how much he had underestimated his duties.
</p>
<p>
Dunster proved to be just what the College needed. Although he found the
College bereft of students, buildings, funds, and government, he quickly
turned the situation around. First he roused and convinced what students
were left in Cambridge to return. He also admitted a new freshman class
and established a three-year degree program so that both classes (Eaton's
and his new one) would graduate at the same time.<a href="#13" class="footnote">13</a>
He then resumed active and frenetic construction of the main hall, while
teaching classes in the Peyntree House that had served as Eaton's lodging
and college. A charter or constitution would have to wait until 1642, when
Harvard's first governing document was passed by the General Court. At
that time, though, Dunster had the powers <em>de facto</em> and was
willing to wait for the <em>de jure</em> grant.
</p>
<p>
Four days after the graduation of the Class of 1642, the General Court
incorporated Harvard College and gave it a stable government with the
following act:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Whereas through the good Hand of God upon us, there is a College founded
in Cambridge in the County of Middlesex, called Harvard College; For the
Encouragement whereof this Court hath given the Sum of &pound;400 and also
the Revenue of the Ferry betwixt Charlestown and Boston, and the the
well-ordering and managing of the said College is of great Concernment.
</p>
<p>
It is therefore ordered by this Court and the Authority thereof, that
the Governour and Deputy Governour, for Time being and all the
Magistrates of this Jurisdiction, together with the teaching Elders of
the six next adjoining Towns, viz. Cambridge, Watertown, Charlestown,
Boston, Roxbury and Dorchester, And the President of the said College,
for the Time being, shall from Time to Time Have Full Power and
Authority to make and establish all such Orders, Statutes and
Constitutions as they shall bee necessary for the instituting guiding
and furthering of the said College, and the several Members thereof,
from Time to Time, in Piety Morality and Learning: And also to Dispose,
Order and Manage to the Use and Behoof of the said College, and Members
thereof, all Gifts, Legacies, Bequeaths, Revenues, Lands and Donations,
as either have been, are, or shall be conferred, bestowed, or any Way
shall fall, or come to the said College. And whereas it may come to
pass that Many of the said Magistrates and said Elders may be Absent,
or otherwise Employed about other weighty Affairs, when the said
College may need their present Help and Counsel, it is therefore
ordered that the greater Number of Magistrates and Elders which shall
be present with the President shall have the Power of the Whole;
Provided that if any Constitution Order or Orders by them made shall be
found hurtful unto the said College or the Members thereof or to the
Weal-publick; Then upon Appeal of the Party or Parties grieved unto the
Company of Overseers first mentioned, they shall repeal the said Order
or Orders (if they see Cause) at their next Meeting, or Stand
Accountable thereof to the Next General Court.<a href="#14" class="footnote">14</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus it formalized the Board of Overseers, which had existed since the act
of 1637 without provision for filling vacancies or for powers other than
"tak[ing] order for a colledge at Newetowne." This act gave the Board
perpetual succession, since no specific individuals were mentioned. It
also gave the Board the ability to accept donations on behalf of the
college, a power that legally only rested with Nathaniel Eaton before
this. Finally, it gave the Board the power to act with a quorum&mdash;an
important power given the busy nature of the magistrates and clergymen.
The Board consisted of the following members, in addition to Dunster:
magistrates, Governor John Winthrop, Deputy Governor John Endecott, Thomas
Dudley, Increase Nowell, Simon Bradstreet, John Winthrop Jr., Richard
Bellingham, Israel Stoughton, Richard Saltonstall, Thomas Flint, and
William Pynchon; ministers, Thomas Shepard, George Phillips, John Knowles,
Zechariah Symmes, Thomas Allen, John Wilson, John Cotton, John Eliot, and
Richard Mather.<a href="#15" class="footnote">15</a> Of these, fifteen
were graduates of English universities and six were not.<a href="#16" class="footnote">16</a>
This model for the Board of Overseers was so effective that it was not
substantially altered until 1851.
</p>
<p>
The Board promptly named Herbert Pelham its treasurer, created and adopted
the Harvard seal<a href="#17" class="footnote">17</a>, audited the donation accounts, and
appointed two recent graduates to tutorships. After this business was
accomplished, they began passing the bylaws necessary for college
government. These nineteen 'Rules and Precepts' outlined for the student
such things as entrance requirements, rules of behavior, guiding
principles, and degree requirements. These bylaws were unique in several
respects, which I shall discuss later, but inspiration was surely drawn on
the Elizabethan statutes of the University of Cambridge, a printed copy of
which was in Dunster's possession.<a href="#18" class="footnote">18</a>
</p>
<p>
While the Board of Overseers was the principal form of Harvard's
government, the President exercised powers as well. The bylaws of the
Board neither specified a curriculum nor defined punishments for offenses.
These were the duties of the President, although Dunster was also sole
instructor for the entire Class of 1642 and primary instructor throughout
his tenure.
</p>
<p>
The students were divided into freshman, sophomore, junior sophister, and
senior sophister classes, according to the years of attendance they had
put in. (Naturally, this four-year distinction took effect after the Class
of 1642 graduated). Much like one would expect, the freshman were expected
to do menial chores for the upperclassmen at the penalty of hazing.<a href="#19" class="footnote">19</a>
The advancement between classes was based on passing an oral disputation
given each year near the time of Commencement. Failure meant staying at
the current class standing for another year.<a href="#20" class="footnote">20</a>
</p>
<p>
The curriculum was quite impressive. It consisted of logic, physics, Greek
etymology, Greek syntax, Greek grammar, Hebrew grammar, rhetoric,
divinity; and history for the freshman; ethics, politics, Greek
literature, Hebrew literature, divinity, rhetoric, and botany for the
sophomores; and arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, Greek style, Greek
composition, Hebrew literature, divinity, rhetoric, history, and botany
for the upperclassmen. Before a student could receive his bachelor's of
arts degree, he had to be "able to read the Originalls of the Old and New
Testament into the Latine tongue, and to resolve them Logically; withall
being of godly life and conversation; and at any publick Act hath the
Approbation of the Overseers and Master of the Colledge."<a href="#21" class="footnote">21</a>
The course work outlined above certainly prepared him for those
requirements.
</p>
<p>
Commencement must have been quite a sight. Several contemporary accounts
of the commencement exercises have been recorded. <cite>New England's
First Fruits</cite> describes the event best:
</p>
<blockquote>
The Students of the first Classis that have beene these foure yeeres
trained up in University-Learning (for their ripening in the knows ledge
of the Tongues, and Arts) and are approved for their manner-as they have
kept their publick Acts in former yeares, ourselves being present, at
them; so have they lately kept two Solemne Acts for their Commencement,
when the Governour, Magistrates, and the Ministers from all parts, with
all sorts of Schollars, and others in great numbers were present, and did
heare their Exercises; which were Latine and Greeke Orations, and
Declamations, and Hebrew Analasis, Grammaticall, Logicall &amp;
Rhetoricall of the Psalms: And their Answers and Disputations in Logicall,
Ethicall, Physicall and Metaphysicall Questions; and so were found worthy
of the first degree, (commonly called Batchelour) <em>pro more Academiarum
in Anglia<a href="#22" class="footnote">22</a></em>: Being first presented
by the President to the Magistrates and Ministers, and by him, upon their
Approbation, solemnly admitted unto the same degree, and a Booke of Arts
delivered into each of their hands, and power given them to read Lectures
in the Hall upon any of the Arts, when they shall be thereunto called, and
a liberty of studying in the Library.<a href="#23" class="footnote">23</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
One can imagine that first group of nine seniors standing in front of a
great crowd of their younger peers, the elected officials of the Colony,
and all of the clergy while defending philosophic theses in Latin, Greek,
and Hebrew. It was truly an achievement that should elicit pride in
Dunster and the Board of Overseers. What had once been a crushing
disappointment had been rehabilitated.
</p>
<p>
This was the state of Harvard College by the time of its first graduating
class. The government consisted of a twenty-one member Board of Overseers
and a President. The curriculum covered the span of categories of human
learning at that time. The college had officially been incorporated as a
legal entity. Eight years after the first class graduated, the General
Court passed the Charter of 1650 which added a new dimension to Harvard
government.
</p>
<p>
This Charter incorporated Harvard College in 1650 by creating a
corporation consisting of the President, Treasurer, and five Fellows.
These seven members were also given the authority previously held by the
Board of Overseers: the power to "purchase and acquire to themselves or
take and receave uppon Free guift and donation any Lands Tenements or
Heriditaments within this Jurisdiction of the Massatusetts &hellip;."<a href="#24" class="footnote">24</a>
It gave the members the right of perpetual succession and the right to sue
and be sued as an entity. In short, it conferred some traditional
corporate rights and privileges.
</p>
<p>
It also established the Board of Overseers as overseers of the corporation
by giving it veto power on any statute or law the corporation enacted. In
an appendix to the Charter of 1650 passed in 1657, the Overseer's role in
relation to the corporation was more explicitly spelled out:
</p>
<blockquote>
&hellip; the corporation shall have power from time to time to make such
orders and by lawes for the better ordering and carrying on of the worke
of the colledge, as they shall see cawse, without depending upon the
consent of the overseers foregoing; provided, always, that the corporation
shall be responsable unto, and those orders and by lawes shallbe alterable
by, the overseers according to theire discretion.<a href="#25" class="footnote">25</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus, the corporation was responsible for the day-to-day business of the
college, providing its actions met with the approval of the Board of
Overseers. The average age of the corporation members, at that time, was
only twenty-four<a href="#26" class="footnote">26</a>  and the General
Court wanted to protect the Colony's interests in Harvard College. The
Board of Overseers, with its considerable experience in college
administration, was the perfect vehicle for so doing.
</p>
<p>
Now let's turn our attention to what was happening in higher education on
the other side of the Atlantic. A brief look into the histories and
practices of the University of Cambridge and Oxford University will
illuminate the highly unusual beginnings of Harvard College.
</p>
<p>
Sixteen independent colleges comprise the University of Cambridge. They
were independent in the sense that each had separate instruction,
buildings, finances, and discipline. Their sovereignty was much like the
sovereignty of the states in our federal republic; orders could come from
higher up&mdash;such as the university government or the Crown&mdash;but
never from lateral entities. So when we speak of Cambridge's government,
we must keep this federalism in mind.
</p>
<p>
Cambridge's university government was spelled out in the Elizabethan
Statutes. In the medieval era, Cambridge was self-governing: the guild of
professors admitted new members, disbursed funds, and granted degrees.
With the eviction of the Catholic Church by Henry VIII, Cambridge's papal
charter was revoked and it became subject to royal oversight. The
Elizabethan bylaws were the product of concerted fear of a puritan coup
d'universit&eacute; on the part of the Cantabrigian Chancellor and
Vice-Chancellor. They were able to evict the fiery source of the fear,
Thomas Cartwright, but at a cost of vigilant royal oversight and
diminished autonomy of the professors. The regent masters (professors)
complained that "nothing can pass all the whole yeare [that the heads of
the colleges] mislike&hellip;."<a href="#27" class="footnote">27</a>
</p>
<p>
The Elizabethan Statutes went into great detail about nearly every aspect
of the student and professor's life, from the manner and dress of students
to the format of lectures and disputations. These bylaws numbered hundreds
of chapters and scores of pages. The university government had "endeavored
to anticipate every possible exigency, to regulate in a minute degree the
daily life of their foundations, and to prescribe exact punishments for
every imaginable crime and offense."<a href="#28" class="footnote">28</a>
Every official of the university and all students seeking a degree had to
swear a solemn oath to uphold each and every clause of the Elizabethan
Statutes.<a href="#29" class="footnote">29</a> Like all excruciatingly
crafted codes, the Elizabethan Statutes were, for the most part, ignored.
</p>
<p>
The government of the individual colleges was, essentially, the master. No
actions could be undertaken and no decisions implemented without his
consent. Below the master were the fellows, numbering between twelve and
twenty depending on the size of the particular college.<a href="#30" class="footnote">30</a>
The group consisting of the master and his fellows constituted the
governing body of the college. The governing body determined studies,
discipline, and managed the college's property. As I said before, their
decisions could be set aside by royal privilege or university regulation.
</p>
<p>
The curriculum varied from college to college and also from tutor to
tutor. Only one of the tutor's programs has survived, Dr. Richard
Holdsworth's "Directions for a Student in the Universitie." Since Dr.
Holdsworth remained a tutor from 1613 to 1637 (when he was elected master
of Emmanuel College), we can presume that his was probably a
representative curriculum&mdash;one like that which the founders of
Harvard College may have gone through. Holdsworth had the students study
logic, ethics, physics, and metaphysics in the morning lectures&mdash;a
concession to the requirements of the Elizabethan statutes and essentially
the same course taught since the Middle Ages. In the afternoon,
Holdsworth's students could revel in the thoroughly modern<a href="#31" class="footnote">31</a>
arts of rhetoric, history, oratory, and poetry. Holdsworth believed that
these latter were:
</p>
<blockquote>
Studies not less necessarie than the first, if not more usefull, especialy
Latine, and Oratory, without which all the other Learning, though never so
eminent, is in a manner voide and useless. Without those you will be
baffled in your disputes, disgraced and vilified in Publick examinations,
laught at in speeches, and Declamations, you will never dare to appear in
any act of credit in your University, nor must you look for Preferment by
your Learning only.<a href="#32" class="footnote">32</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Baccalaureate ceremonies at Cambridge were quite involved. First, the
senior sophister was examined by his college's officials to determine if
he was ready to be presented to the Vice-Chancellor of the university as a
candidate. If he was ready, he was then given his oral examination by
examiners and other regent masters. If they were satisfied of his
abilities, he had to swear an oath to three articles of the Elizabethan
statutes and face the University Senate. Once the Senate voted positively
on his worthiness, he was admitted 'to the Question' and became a
'Questionist.' This meant that he had to formulate a response to a
question from one of Aristotle's Prior Analytics. After this, he must be
ready during the period of Lent to dispute with any regent master, other
questionist, or sophister sent to take him on. Finally, there was the
bachelors' Commencement&mdash;one last formal, lengthy, and public
disputation.<a href="#33" class="footnote">33</a> Then, the presiding proctor addressed the
prospective bachelors in Latin and conferred the degree.
</p>
<p>
This was the university environment with which 100 of the 130 New England
university men before 1646 were most familiar. The remaining university
men matriculated from Oxford University. Though Oxford was a royalist
stronghold while Cambridge fell to the parliamentarians during the great
rebellion, their differences were minimal.<a href="#34" class="footnote">34</a>
Both were governed by the Elizabethan Statutes. Oxford tended to focus on
mathematics more so than did Cambridge, but both dealt almost exclusively
with theology and its ramifications.
</p>
<p>
The curricula of Harvard and Cambridge were also very similar. Both focus
on the medieval mode of learning, which emphasizes the teachings of the
ancient scholars and philosophers like Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle. This
model of education also concentrates on Latin and the Oriental languages
like Hebrew. That said, though, each contains elements of Renaissance
humanism, which was a reaction to scholasticism. For example, each
university taught Greek, history, rhetoric, and poetry&mdash;all
disciplines regarded as essential to a liberal education. In the
Elizabethan Statutes quoted by Dunster in his <cite>Quadriennium
Memoir</cite>, it says that baccalaureates "shall be assiduous auditors
&hellip; of such lectures of Philosophy, Astronomy, Perspective, or
Mathematics, as shall be read in the Schools, and of the Greek tongue
too&hellip;."<a href="#35" class="footnote">35</a> Given that President
Dunster and most of the Overseers were recent graduates of Cambridge, it
is unsurprising that the Harvard curriculum should reflect their
education. In fact, Dunster even used his Cantabrigian textbooks for
lecture materials.
</p>
<p>
Another of the many similarities between the two academic institutions is
their organization. Each college, subsequent to Harvard's Class of 1642,
divided the bachelor's degree into four years. Each year is referred to
using the same terms: freshman, sophomore, junior sophister, and senior
sophister. Cambridge used the same system, but added to it another level
of organization: the distinctions of status. With the multitude of
colleges, tutors, and study programs at Cambridge, what year you were was
often not a good indicator of your seniority.<a href="#36" class="footnote">36</a>
The American conception of class (as in Class of 1642) took on new meaning
in the English schools&mdash;where it indicated one's economic class.
These distinctions ranged from 'fellow-commoner' (students who paid double
fees and ate meals with the university's fellows) to the sizars (indigent
students who paid reduced fees and performed menial tasks for the
difference).<a href="#37" class="footnote">37</a> In the highly
aristocratic English society, what level you were was secondary to what
your status was.
</p>
<p>
The two colleges also shared a similar philosophy on student life and
extracurricular activity. Universities on the European continent at the
time frequently allowed their students to board in town and attend classes
on the campus. Teachers and administrators were similarly situated.
Dunster, remembering with affinity his college days at the University of
Cambridge, sought to have the "&hellip;Students brought up in a more
<em>Collegiate</em> Way of Living.'<a href="#38" class="footnote">38</a>
For Dunster as well as for the English, it was not just book learning that
gave a student his education. Disputing and engaging other students and
faculty was very beneficial and crucial to a well-rounded education, as
was eating with, drinking with, and praying with other students and their
elders. As the Governing Boards said to some university men in 1671, "It
is wel known to your selves what advantage to Learning accrue's by the
multitude of persons cohabiting for Scholasticall communion, whereby to
actuate the minds of one another, and other waies to promove the ends of a
Colledge-Society."<a href="#39" class="footnote">39</a> For the same
reason, Dunster personally trained all of his future tutors, who then
lived in the Old College building with the students. It was a close and
tightly-knit group.
</p>
<p>
While their similarities show that the Puritans sought to duplicate the
English university model, their differences illustrate the Puritans
independent spirit and sense of right action. The college they created
differed from its English counterparts in its government, its religious
toleration, and its charter.
</p>
<p>
In the area of governmental differences, the office of President stands
out. The President of Harvard College has no exact equivalent in an
English university. At Magdalene College, Dunster's alma mater, the
President was akin to what we would call the Dean of Faculty.<a href="#40" class="footnote">40</a>
It was below the head of the college, who was called the Master. But even
the term for the head of a Cantabrigian college varied: some were called
Masters, some Presidents, and others Provosts. Whatever the college head
was called, his powers were still checked by the Vice-Chancellor of the
university and the Crown's representatives. The position is close in
nature to the Harvard President, but not quite.
</p>
<p>
The nominal head of the University of Cambridge is the Chancellor. At one
time, his power was supreme within the institution. He held the position
of archdeacon within the Catholic Church and reigned over an
ecclesiastical court.<a href="#41" class="footnote">41</a> After Henry
VIII's usurpation of papal authority in England, though, the Chancellor's
power was effectively curtailed. After the Elizabethan Statutes vested the
Vice-Chancellor and sixteen college heads with power, the emasculated
Chancellor became a ceremonial figurehead. The Harvard President fell
somewhere between the former two, with less power than the Vice-Chancellor
but more than a college head. Naturally, the role of the Harvard President
varied considerably; Henry Dunster was very assertive though later
Presidents chose to be more pliant.
</p>
<p>
The nature of the Harvard College Corporation also differed from the
University of Cambridge model. The Harvard College Corporation consisted
of the President, Treasurer, and Fellows of Harvard whereas Cambridge's
corporation consisted on the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, Fellows, and
Scholars of the university. The individual college's corporation consisted
of the head of the college and between six and sixty fellows, depending on
the size of the particular college. Fellows, in the Cantabrigian sense,
received a small stipend, with free room and board plus a fixed allowance
for sundries as well as a dividend if the college declared any profits. If
they did any tutoring and that was optional, they received their pupils'
tuition fees. Finally, fellows were required to become ordained and could
remain fellows for life once elected.<a href="#42" class="footnote">42</a>
The corporation so constituted was the governing body of the college and
could only be second-guessed by the King and any university regulations.
</p>
<p>
As noted before, Harvard's corporation was overshadowed by the Board of
Overseers. Its fellows were transient, with eight fellowship appointments
by 1653. Dunster complained that the fellows "being so unsetled and so
often changed, that ever and anon all the work committed unto them falleth
agen on my shoulders."<a href="#43" class="footnote">43</a> Also, the
fellows were ostensibly engaged in teaching or researching, though only
two of the five were so doing in 1653. The fellows were very young; the
average age in 1650 being just twenty-four.<a href="#44" class="footnote">44</a>
Within a few months of the charter's approval, all but one had left making
Samuel Eaton at twenty the sole and senior teaching fellow!<a href="#45" class="footnote">45</a>
Furthermore, its edicts and orders could be overruled by the Overseers. In
short, even though the Charter of 1650 established the corporation as an
autonomous entity which operated the College and acted except where
overruled, it quickly devolved into an ineffectual sibling of the Board of
Overseers. Where Cambridge's corporations were powerful, Harvard's was
weak&mdash;at least during the 17th century.
</p>
<p>
The Board of Overseers was seen by the General Court as a check on the
youthful and inexperienced corporation. Since it had already been running
the College since 1642 and doing a fine job, the Board of Overseers
allayed the General Court's fears of another scandal on the order of
Nathaniel Eaton. Its role was like that of Visitor at Cambridge, since its
official function was to keep a watchful eye on the actions of the college
officers. At Cambridge, though, the Visitor was an umpire in disputes
only.<a href="#46" class="footnote">46</a> The Board had great powers
under the Charter of 1650, far more than a Visitor would. The General
Court, then, obviously viewed the Board of Overseers not as a Visitor, but
as a second governing entity. The Visitor, properly understood, was the
General Court: "Such a State of Dependency, for the Continuance of their
Being on the Court, does not seem to imply that the Overseers of said
College were, in and by their Constitution, the Visitors of said College;
For Visitors, as such, have not a dependent precarious Existence."<a href="#47" class="footnote">47</a>
The corporation initiated statutes and elections, but the Board had to
ratify its decisions. The Board of Overseers could then protect the
Commonwealth's interests.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, though, the Board of Overseers completely sidestepped the
corporation. The Overseers elected Presidents Chauncy and Hoar, Dunster's
successors. The Overseers also directed teaching fellows' stipends and
payments by the Treasurer.<a href="#48" class="footnote">48</a> These
actions were the province of the corporation as dictated by the Charter of
1650. But, after Dunster's resignation, the corporation became leaderless
and disorganized. The Board of Overseers, then, was acting in its capacity
as protector of the public trust.
</p>
<p>
The final aspect of college government in which Harvard and the English
universities differed was college statutes. The Elizabethan Statutes, or
more properly called the Code of Statutes of 12 Elizabeth, were onerous
and comprehensive. The same can be said of Oxford's implementation of the
Elizabethan Statutes called the Laudian Code of Statutes. These codes of
statutes ran to dozens of pages and spelled out student and faculty's
conduct to such a degree that few followed them.
</p>
<p>
Harvard's bylaws, by contrast, outlined general principles of conduct.
They left specific judgment of conduct to the President as well as
specific punishment. In the first code of 'Rules and Precepts' printed in
1646, there is a rule against missing classes and prayers that is a good
example of the nature of Harvard's bylaws. It reads: "If any Scholar
beeing in health shall bee absent from prayer or Lectures, except in case
of urgent necessity or by the Leave of his tutour, hee shall bee liable to
admonition (or such punishment as the president shall thinke meet) if hee
offend above once a weeke."<a href="#49" class="footnote">49</a>
They followed Overseer Thomas Shepard's advice: "the consequences will be
very sad &hellip; to make more sins then (as yet is seene) God himselfe
hath made."<a href="#50" class="footnote">50</a>
</p>
<p>
The difference in intent and execution will be clear when two similar
statutes are contrasted. Both of these statutes sought to protect students
from the temptations of neglecting their school work that recreational
events and fairs represented. Here is Harvard's version:
</p>
<blockquote>
No Schollar whatever without the fore acquaintance and leave of the
President and his Tutor, or in the absence of either of them two of the
Fellowes shal bee present at or in any of the Publike Civil meetings or
Concourse of people as Courts of justice, elections, fayres, or at
military exercise in the time or howers of the Colledge exercise Publike
or private neither shal any schollar exercise himself in any Military
band, unlesse of knowne gravity and of approoved, sober and vertuous
conversation and that with leave of the President and his Tutor.<a href="#51" class="footnote">51</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oxford's statute, and a similar prohibition at Cambridge, was considerably
more specific:
</p>
<blockquote>
Undergraduates, under pain of whipping, are required to abstain from the
use of dice and playing-cards; from the <em>ludum pil&aelig; pedalis</em>
(football), the <em>lusus Globorum</em> (tennis?), cudgel-play, and other
'vain sports' of this kind; from hunting and keeping hounds, hawks,
ferrets, gins, and nets; from discharging guns or cross-bows; and from
attending exhibitions of strolling players, rope-dancers, and
prize-fighters.<a href="#52" class="footnote">52</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
From these two statutes, we can see that Harvard's gave the student the
potential to attend the prohibited events if he could get the President's
permission. It also did not specify the mandatory punishment if the rule
was violated, giving the President discretion where his students were
concerned.
</p>
<p>
The most surprising difference between Harvard and the English
universities&mdash;and the rest of the colony to boot&mdash;was Harvard's
lack of a religious test for students, graduates, and officers of the
college. Religious oaths were prevalent throughout the colony and in most
other colonies save Quaker Pennsylvania. In fact, in 1640 there was no
university in the Christian world where some form of religious test or
oath was not used.<a href="#53" class="footnote">53</a> The Elizabethan
and Laudian Statutes of Cambridge and Oxford were suffused with religious
provisions to which students and administrators must affirm. In fact,
every student who was a candidate for a degree had to subscribe to the
Three Articles of James I:
</p>
<blockquote>
I. That the king's majesty, under God, is the only supreme governor of
this realm &hellip; as well in all spiritual or ecclesiastical things or
causes, as temporal&hellip;. II. That the Book of Common Prayer &hellip;
containeth in it nothing contrary to the word of God &hellip; and that he
himself will use the form in the said book prescribed, in public prayer,
and administration of the sacraments, and none other &hellip;. III.
&hellip; That he acknowledgeth the Thirty-nine Articles &hellip; to be
agreeable to the word of God.<a href="#54" class="footnote">54</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
The closest the Harvard bylaws come to a religious test is the following
articles from the 'Rules and Precepts':
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
2. Let every Student be plainly instructed, and earnestly pressed to
consider well, the maine end of his life and studies is, <em>to know God
and Jesus Christ which is eternall life</em>, Joh. 17. 3. and therefore to
lay <em>Christ</em> in the bottome, as the only foundation of all sound
knowledge and Learning. And seeing the Lord only giveth wisedome, Let
every one seriously set himself by prayer in secret to seeke it of him
<em>Prov</em> 2, 3.<a href="#55" class="footnote">55</a>
</p>
<p>
4. Every one shall so exercise himself in reading the Scriptures twice
a day that they bee ready to give an account of their proficiency
theerein, both in theoreticall observations of Language and Logicke,
and in practicall and spirituall truthes as their tutour shall require
according to their severall abilities respectively, seeing the Entrance
of the word giveth light, etc. psal. 119. 130.<a href="#56" class="footnote">56</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, the Charters of 1642 and 1650 do not give any religious
requirements or tests. It is very hard to believe that a college so
obviously important to the Puritans would escape their quest for dogmatic
orthodoxy.
</p>
<p>
The reason for this omission has not been recorded for posterity, but
there are some likely causes. First among them is the fact that most of
the Overseers and important founders of Harvard were alumni of the
University of Cambridge. Having seen, in their own minds, the impotence of
such oaths as required by the Elizabethan Statutes, they probably thought
tests to be a tradition best left on the other side of the Atlantic.
Another possible justification is the utter homogeneity of religion in the
colony. When dissent is not tolerated within the colony proper, there is
little to fear by the college. This reason doesn't stand up, though, since
the colony at this time was still recovering from the Anne Hutchinson
heresy. Whatever the reason, it was definitely not religious toleration
that motivated the failure to create religious oaths and tests.
</p>
<p>
By now, it should be obvious that the founders of Harvard College had the
University of Cambridge as their model. It should also be obvious that
they sought to improve on that model by adopting a system of government
more modest and suited to a small college and dropping ineffectual
traditions. They kept the curriculum that had made them educated men as
well as the student life that complemented their education. Like many
other institutions, Harvard was the product of the Puritan's desire to
reproduce English society with the wicked or imperfect aspects removed.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the Puritans did not have the legal right to do so. The
colony's charter contained no transfer of authority to create corporations
from the King. In English law at the time, only the Crown was vested with
the power to incorporate. Corporations could create other corporations
only if specifically granted that right. That is why the Board of
Overseers was set up as a trust. The 1601 Statute of Charitable Uses made
it possible to establish an educational trust and avoid the time and
expense of seeking a royal charter.<a href="#57" class="footnote">57</a>
This allowed the General Court a means of creating the college that would
not arouse royal perjoration.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the corporation created by the Charter of 1650 was
blatant overstepping of power. The General Court had no right to
incorporate anything and it knew it. In the <cite>General Laws and
Liberties</cite> editions of 1660 and 1672, the General Court recorded the
act of 1642 that established the unincorporated Board but never mentioned
the corporation or the Charter of 1650.<a href="#58" class="footnote">58</a>
Since this publication was the official record of laws in the Colony and
was sent to England, it is not an unreasonable supposition that the
General Court did not want to publicize its transgression and invite royal
investigation. Subsequent charters show a similar penchant for assuming
royal authority.
</p>
<p>
As if that were not enough, President Dunster and the Overseers also
overreached their authority when they granted the first set of degrees.
S.E. Morison, the foremost historian of Harvard, called Dunster's
conferring of degrees "the boldest thing [they] did; it was almost a
declaration of independence from King Charles."<a href="#59" class="footnote">59</a>
In England, there were only two academic institutions that could legally
grant degrees: Oxford and Cambridge. Neither of Harvard's charters
mentioned the authority to confer degrees. That the Overseers and Harvard
administrators were aware of their lack of authority is evident from the
actions of Increase Mather, Harvard President from 1685 to 1707. His
Charter of 1692 contains the following provision:
</p>
<blockquote>
And whereas it is a laudable Custome in Universities whereby Learning has
been Encouraged and Advanced to confer Academical Degrees or Titles on
those who by their Proficiency as to Knowledge in Theology, Law, Physick,
Mathematicks or Philosophy have been Judged Worthy thereof. &hellip; the
President and Fellowes of the said Colledge shall have power from time to
time, to grant and admit to Academical Degrees, as in the Universities in
England, such as in respect of Learning and Good Manners, they shall find
worthy to be promoted thereunto.<a href="#60" class="footnote">60</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus, until 1692, Harvard degrees were not officially sanctioned by any
government. Of course, the government that sanctioned Harvard's ability to
grant degrees was itself acting without authority. In reality, Harvard's
authority to grant degrees was acquired through the legal process of
prescription. In other words, Harvard acquired the power to confer degrees
because no one challenged its authority to do so.<a href="#61" class="footnote">61</a>
</p>
<p>
Whether the General Court had the authority to incorporate Harvard or
Dunster had the power to confer degrees, Harvard is easily the oldest
corporation in the United States still operating under its original grant
or charter.<a href="#62" class="footnote">62</a> It has existed more or
less in its original form and conception for over three hundred and fifty
years. It could not have become the most prominent American university
without the hard work and effort of its founders. These founders created
an academic institution unlike any that existed in its time.
</p>
<p>
They took the best parts of the English universities&mdash;their
curricula, student life, and academic standards&mdash;and avoided the
problems&mdash;bureaucracy, religious persecution, and overzealous
statutes. The founders succeeded in their goal of "advanc[ing]
<em>Learning</em> and perpetuat[ing] it to Posterity."<a href="#63" class="footnote">63</a>
Their actions constituted independence, for they serenely assumed powers
that they knew they did not have. The founding of Harvard College is an
interesting and inspiring story. Interesting, because it is virtually
unknown; inspiring, because the principals persevered and confidently
asserted their independence. Increase Mather, an important minister and
Harvard president, had this to say about the college:
</p>
<blockquote>
The <em>Colledge</em> by Ingenuous and Civil Education hath had its proper
influence. The <em>Colledge</em> which <em>we</em> say was a
<em>Noble</em> and <em>Necessary</em> Work, and therefore deserves all
Encouragement and Promotion. <em>Noble</em>; for where is the like in all
the English America? Where, even among those that in wealth do far Exceed
the poor Laborious New-Englanders, is there are such thing? And
<em>Necessary</em> too; for else the Rising Generations would have soon
become barbarous; because neither would their Estates reach to seek
Education in <em>England</em>; neither would any person of worth goe from
hence (unless driven by Persecution) so far off to seek Employment when he
might have it nearer home. 'T was therefore a brave and happy thought that
first pitched upon this <em>Colledge</em>.<a href="#64" class="footnote">64</a>

<br />Last week, I <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/cheap-lunch.cfm">mentioned</a> that we were going to be getting Subway subs for $1 thanks to Go Daddy's treat.<br /><br />Today was the first day that they offered it. Unfortunately, they didn't plan adequately for the popularity of cheap eats so I missed out. I went over there three times only to find out that they had sold out each time.<br /><br />Perhaps the Go Daddy tradition of rolling our own will be extended to this new program as well. Naturally, I'd prefer free food but I'd gladly pay a nominal fee for a good lunch.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Oh and I heard from the lady running this that the next order will be enough to feed fully a third of the staff. Here's hoping that I can start enjoying some cheap food.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (8/27/2005): They were definitely prepared this next time. The Subway franchisee gave his <em>mea culpa</em> and brought more than enough. I had the 6" turkey and it was delicious.]<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

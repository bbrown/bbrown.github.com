I stumbled this weekend across an intriguing <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/92371/Outdoor-theater-on-the-cheap">Ask Metafilter post</a> about backyard theaters. With the <a href="/2008/05/14/moving-to-a-small-town.aspx">idea of community building</a> on my mind, visions of neighborhood movie nights swirled in my mind. People love drive-ins and a well-considered slate of movies could really bring out the people.
</p>
<p>
In the ensuing thread, I found an <a href="http://backyardtheater.com/forums/">awesome site</a> for doing it right. It covers all the technical details as well as the logistical ones. For example, showing a movie to anyone interested in attending is considered a public viewing and would therefore require a <a href="http://www.swank.com/">public performance license</a>. But showing a movie only to invited guests is a private viewing, like watching your DVD at home.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the possible community aspects, I could see using a backyard theater for poolside movie watching or the inevitable slumber party fun. I am really jazzed about the idea, but I'm going to wait to act on it because there's so much other groundwork that is more pressing.

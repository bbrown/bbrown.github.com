<br />I discovered that I really like <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator/">Automator</a>. I've always wanted to download all the PDFs in the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/azbio/azbio.htm">Hayden Pioneer Biographies</a> collection, but all the web sucking applications I've tried&#x2014;well&#x2014;suck.<br /><br />Automator made short work of the task. It's not perfect: it stumbled hard on a bad link&#x2014;just failed outright, no more processing. I wish it had some sort of basic conditional that would allow parts of the workflow to fail without stopping the entire workflow. I guess that's probably a future release (I hope).<br /><br />Still, it was neat to see how easy it was to get started and run. I know Applescript would be perfect here, but I just can't seem to figure out the language. I'm used to C# or PHP or ColdFusion or ASP&#x2014;they all spurn verbosity. Applescript revels in it and my mind is just too attuned to a different approach to syntax. Maybe it's high time I dabbled; I think I would be much more productive if I took the plunge.<br /><br /><br />

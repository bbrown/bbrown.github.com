<br /><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, the <a href="/values/places/google.cfm">search engine of choice</a> at the <acronym title="Bill Brown Information Center">BBIC</acronym>, is set to offer a <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20030506/wr_nm/tech_google_dc_1">blog tab</a> on its main search page. <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a> has <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30621.html">more details</a>.<br /><br />I think that this is a very good move. I, too, am sick of the importance garnered by blogs in the search results&#x2014;even though I am a recipient of expedited indexing. It will help people, like myself, who sometimes just want to search blogs and sometimes not blogs. It also gets Google out of the bind it's gotten in by the skewing of results by concerted blog efforts.<br /><br />[UPDATE: <a href="http://www.evhead.com/">Evan Williams</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> founder and current Google employee, <a href="http://www.evhead.com/archives/2003_05_09_archive_default.asp#105249734199128166">dismissed</a> Orlowski's musings recently.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 2: <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/">Eric Sink</a> has an <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/Dear_Google.html">open letter to Google</a> on this subject, summed up thusly: "As much as possible, we want you to show us the web without affecting it, and index the web without organizing it." Good stuff!]<br /><br /><br />

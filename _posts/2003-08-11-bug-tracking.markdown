<br />For future reference (and eventual installation): <a href="http://www.atpm.com/9.08/cvstrac.shtml">CVSTrac</a>, a Web-based bug tracking application that integrates with CVS. It's free and uses a file-based database system for easy backup.<br /><br />[UPDATE (8/12/03): I installed it and it exceeded my expectations beyond what I could have imagined. Where I couldn't get <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> to work on my laptop, I couldn't believe how simple this one was to install. And the features! Oh the features! Check out a live example at <a href="http://cvs.cvstrac.org/">cvs.cvstrac.org</a> and click around, especially the timeline. Open source never ceases to astound me.]<br /><br /><br />

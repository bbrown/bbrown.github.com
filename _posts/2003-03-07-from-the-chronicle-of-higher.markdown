<br />From <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/"><cite>The Chronicle of Higher Education</cite></a>: <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/free/v49/i21/21b02001.htm">"The Seven Warning Signs of Bogus Science"</a> by <a href="http://www.house.gov/science/park_4-9.html" title="Testimony before a House subcommittee about what a bad idea the International Space Station is. My hero!">Robert Park</a>, who wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195147103/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Voodoo Science</cite></a>&#x2014;an excellent elaboration of the themes in this article which I recommend highly.<br /><br /><blockquote><br />I began this list of warning signs to help federal judges detect scientific nonsense. But as I finished the list, I realized that in our increasingly technical society, spotting voodoo science is a skill that every citizen should develop.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Amen to that. Skepticism and incredulity are in short supply nowadays, though I suppose they were never particularly <em>en vogue</em>.<br /><br /><br />

<br />Ugh, I have to use Internet Explorer to post these entries instead of my preferred browser, <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/" title="Huge featureset, great looks, Cocoa-goodness!">OmniWeb</a>. For some reason, OmniWeb's not posting forms well or not interpreting the JavaScript that Blogger uses.<br /><br /><br />

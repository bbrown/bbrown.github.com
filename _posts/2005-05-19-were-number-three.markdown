<br />We just got notified this morning that Go Daddy has taken <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/pressreleases/NR_GD_3rd_largest_hosting_provider_Final.pdf">the third spot in the shared hosting market</a>. Apparently, Go Daddy has over 670,000 shared hosting accounts.<br /><br />All I've got to say is holy moly! I had no idea that the hosting was so big, though this <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/hosting/shared.asp">comparison of our plans</a> is a big clue as to why. What's even more impressive is that all these accounts didn't exist in December 2002.<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

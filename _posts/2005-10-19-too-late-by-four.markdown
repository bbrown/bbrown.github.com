<br />So I've long said that I'm not going to buy another Macintosh until they went <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/dualcore.html">quad processor</a>. It seemed to me that if they could have two CPUs they have could have four. Why wouldn't I wait for some monster of a machine before plunking down the Mac premium?<br /><br />They finally make one, but it's on a CPU that they've publicly deprecated. Oh sure, it'll be around forever and blah, blah, blah. As someone who bought a 68040-based Mac a month before Apple unveiled the PowerPC chip, I'm not going to be relegated to the Mac ghetto again. Once the Intel-based CPUs exist across the line, the formerly slavered-over G5s will be like the G4s were when the G5 was announced.<br /><br />The other major objection, that four cores is four cores, forgets that Apple can't take a step back performance-wise when they move the platform. The bar has been set and anything in the future will have to be a step up. Since I am not currently hurting for a new computer, I can wait. Nay, I must wait.<br /><br /><br />

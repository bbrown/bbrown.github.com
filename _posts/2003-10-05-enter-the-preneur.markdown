<br />I've recently discovered the <a href="http://www.startupgarden.com/">StartupGarden.com</a>, a site by Tom Ehrenfeld about starting your own business. I've devoured it, going incrementally through the archives. That's something I rarely do anymore since most sites just aren't worth the time. This one's not like that&#x2014;I've also checked out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071368248/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link">the book</a> of the same name. I'll post a review once I'm done with it<br /><br />Some of the interesting entries I've found: <a href="http://www.startupgarden.com/mt/archives/000029.html">good books on entrepreneurship</a> (and then <a href="http://www.startupgarden.com/mt/archives/000028.html">some more</a>), <a href="http://www.startupgarden.com/mt/archives/000030.html">movies for entrepreneurs</a>, <a href="http://www.startupgarden.com/mt/archives/000020.html">how now is the time for entrepreneurship</a>, and <a href="http://www.startupgarden.com/mt/archives/000004.html">the one-page business proposal</a>. There's also a handy <a href="http://www.startupgarden.com/resources.html">resources for entrepreneuers</a> page and <a href="http://www.startupgarden.com/articles.html">his articles</a>. Finally, he's got an interesting lecture on <a href="http://streams.wgbh.org/forum/forum.php?lecture_id=1017">WGBH's site</a>.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Here are some reviews of the book: <a href="http://www.inc.com/search/24136.html"><cite>Inc.</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/business/columnists/richard_pachter/383%0D3982.htm"><cite>The Miami Herald</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.markbernstein.org/Books12.html#note_31857">Mark Bernstein</a>]<br /><br /><br />

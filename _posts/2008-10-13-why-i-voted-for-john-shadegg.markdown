I am a longtime fan of John Shadegg. I have voted for him in every election he's been on my ballot. I was heartened to see his name in opposition to the bailout bill when it failed in the House of Representatives. And I was disgusted when I saw his name in support when it came back around, this time with pork.
</p>
<p>
My initial idea was to punish him by voting for Bob Lord, his Democratic opponent. But that was just the initial feeling of betrayal talking. If I let politicians stabbing me in the back determine who to vote for, my voting would be governed solely by revenge. In today's political climate of unprincipled pragmatism, flipping politicians are in fashion.

After reading <a href="http://johnshadegg.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=104390">his reason for the reversal</a>, I'm certain that he is definitely not <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DC1639F937A15756C0A966958260">his father</a>. If Barack Obama gets elected, we'll need all the Republicans we can get in Congress so I just couldn't let my disappointment affect the long-range view. And he is more oriented towards small government than most of his GOP brethren.

<br />I am not a big fan of forwarded material and, thankfully, the only person who consistently forwards me stuff is my dad so it's completely manageable for me. Also, he generally forwards pretty funny stuff. This one is funny in the cute and perhaps clever sense. I'm snipping out anything that didn't make me smile or laugh:<br /><ul><li>Chickens:The only animals you eat before they are born and after they are dead.</li><li>Committee:A body that keeps minutes and wastes hours.</li><li>Gossip:Never tell a lie if the truth will do more damage.</li><li>Inflation: Cutting money in half with out damaging the paper.</li><li>Mosquito:An insect that makes you like flies better.</li><li>Secret:Something to tell to one person at a time.</li><li>Tomorrow:One of the greatest labor saving devices of today.</li><li>Yawn:An honest opinion openly expressed.</li></ul><br /><br /><br />

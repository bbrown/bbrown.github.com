<br /><a href="http://sastools.com/b2/">Sanjay</a> has a <a href="http://sastools.com/b2/post/79394202">great tip</a> to speed up your Acrobat 6 startup for Windows. I don't know if it works for Mac OS X as well&#x2014;it probably should&#x2014;because <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Panther</a>'s <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/preview/">Preview</a> app is so freakin' fast that I don't care. That and I only have Acrobat Reader 5 installed because I never saw a need to upgrade, which is <em>very</em> unusual for me, the Upgrade King.<br /><br /><br />

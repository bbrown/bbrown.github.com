<br />Weirdness I saw today: a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/researchtriangle/lab/7139/custom.html" title="I don't think that this is the one I saw, though.">red DeLorean</a>, a postman with enormous <a href="http://www.ourreallybigadventure.com/activities/facial4.html">mutton chops</a> and a <a href="http://www.safetycentral.com/delstrawsafp.html">pith helmet</a>, and a lady standing in the open door of her running car being photographed in front of Babies 'R' Us. Sadly, I was <em>sans camera</em>.<br /><br /><br />

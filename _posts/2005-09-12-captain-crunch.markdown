<br />Well, the product I'm developing is slated to be complete by the next next Thursday so that means that we're entering <a href="http://www.igda.org/articles/erobinson_crunch.php">crunch mode</a>. I think it's a good thing because it's going to be rather limited. At my last job, crunch mode lasted for upwards of six weeks followed by six months of total slack before we finally released. Two weeks of frenetic effort strikes me as utterly reasonable.<br /><br />Point is, don't expect any entries in that time. I've already <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/archives/2005/09/blogging-vacation">begged my pardons</a> over at Found on the Web. A two-week absence is not particularly abnormal round these blogging parts, but I thought I'd tell you all the same.<br /><br /><br />

<br />Well, my wife's water broke this morning and FedEx suggests that my Panther package is on the truck. I hope they don't require a signature&#x2026;<br /><br />In other words, I'll get two great upgrades in one day!<br /><br />[UPDATE: Okay, there'll only be one great upgrade today. Turns out that Sandi's water <em>didn't</em> break, but she was having some serious amniotic fluid-wannabe discharge. Even her doctor thought she was ready. Luckily, the hospital visit was fairly minimal.]<br /><br /><br />

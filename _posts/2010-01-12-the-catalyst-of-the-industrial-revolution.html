<p>
The Industrial Revolution remains one of the most controversial episodes
in American history. Many scholars have vilified the entrepreneurs of the
time as "robber barons" and scoundrels with few exceptions. Business
historians, in the main, have treated the Industrial Revolution with moral
blinders on, objectively examining the history of the many corporations
that were created during this period while refraining from drawing
conclusions about the larger events.<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a>
Its importance is obvious: the significance of the modernization of the
American economy and its rocketing to global dominance cannot be
understated. But was this robust growth effected by the exploitation of
the workers or through shady business dealings alone? Stripped of moral
reproach or microscopic specialization, what are the underlying facts of
the revolution? In this essay, we will examine the nature and source of
the Industrial Revolution in America&mdash;showing its different phases
and explaining its causes&mdash;in an effort to understand how businessmen
were able to realize a level of economic growth unprecedented in all of
history.
</p>
<p>
Before we begin, was the Industrial Revolution really a revolution?
Sociologist James DeFronzo, in his book <cite>Revolutions and
Revolutionary Movements</cite>, defines revolution as a "social movement
in which participants are organized to alter drastically or replace
totally existing social, economic, or political institutions."<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a>
This definition is not particularly useful here, though, because it
primarily applies to political revolutions, such as those in Russia,
China, and France. One could not call the Industrial Revolution a "social
movement" since it was not society at all that changed the economic
structures. Moreover, the Industrial Revolution did not alter the
political institutions of America&mdash;the limited government present
before the revolution was just as limited after it.<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a>
</p>
<p>
Better is historian William N. Parker's phrasing: "'Revolution', as the
word is used in economic history, commonly means a thoroughgoing change in
production processes and in the social organization of labour, occurring
at a faster than customary pace."<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a> The
Industrial Revolution was a move away from cottage-based production and
into the modern factory system. In addition, labor's role in production
was more strictly delimited. No longer was production performed by
apprentices at a master's direction&mdash;each apprentice doing varied
work as required by each product or item. Instead, managers set up the
factory such that each worker had but one task to perform and that manual
task was repeated day in and day out, day after day. Using this conception
of revolution, we can see that the Industrial Revolution is clearly a
"real" revolution.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, our goal in this essay is to understand the nature
of the American Industrial Revolution and the catalytic/causal forces that
drove it. Over the years, there have been a number of different theories
advanced to account for the Industrial Revolution and its spectacular
production of wealth. The two most prevalent are Marxism and determinism.
These two have had the most influence in American historical thought, but
there have been others. These other theories tend to not have the same
influence because they, like the aforementioned case studies of individual
corporations, are insufficient for understanding.
</p>
<p>
The "great-man" theory, for example, posits that history is driven by
superlative individuals and would have been totally different without
them. In business history, this means that men like Rockefeller and
Carnegie were the engines of the Revolution. I do not mean to downplay
their importance, but the theory fails to account for the multitude of
other firms that lacked such powerful leaders yet still played important
roles.
</p>
<p>
Some have also argued that factors that are unique to America produced the
stunning  growth. American isolation from warring powers, its extensive
natural resources, and its significant immigration have all been proposed
as causes of economic growth. While these are all important factors, none
of them are fundamental since other nations have lacked such factors and
have still experienced significant growth. Thus, I will confine myself to
examining only the two most important theories.
</p>
<p>
Of these, Marxism is, by far, the predominant explanation. In this theory,
workers were responsible for production of goods. The entrepreneurs took
these goods and marked them up in order to make a profit. In other words,
big business prospered on the backs of its workers. As Lawrence Glickman
put it, "wage slavery resulted from the difference in value between what
workers produced and what they earned in wages, which was often said to
have been stolen from them."<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a> Thus, the
source of the Industrial Revolution's wealth generation was the
exploitation of its workers. Karl Marx observed that, under capitalism, to
"be a productive laborer is &hellip; not a piece of luck, but a
misfortune."<a href="#6" class="footnote">6</a> To be sure, Marxist theory
recognizes that workers themselves did not have adequate capital to
purchase the expensive machinery necessary for maximum production.
Instead, Marxism holds that this machinery enabled "employers to use fixed
capital, to increase the pace of production, lengthen the working day, and
<em>extract increased surplus</em>."<a href="#7" class="footnote">7</a>
</p>
<p>
Why, then, did the Industrial Revolution happen when it did? Parker
suggests that a "&hellip; change in technology or organization (or in
both) in one sector conduce[s] to parallel or reciprocal changes in the
other."<a href="#8" class="footnote">8</a> In other words, the changing
agricultural sector led to growth in the industrial sector. Parker, then,
agrees with Marx: "the development of capitalism in agriculture required
the displacement of the village system of tenure and work organization,
and that displacement in turn 'released productive forces' which allowed
commercial farming and modern factory industry to grow within a market
economy, i.e. within a capitalist framework."<a href="#9" class="footnote">9</a>
The move of labor away from agriculture provided the capitalists human
fodder to work their machinery and generate their profits.
</p>
<p>
Another important framework for explaining the American Industrial
Revolution is determinism. Determinism in this context can be found in two
variations: market and technological. Market determinism, propounded by
historian Robert Higgs, holds that the revolution was the inevitable
consequence of market forces. The individuals participating in the market
are merely responding to economic laws through economic calculation. Higgs
notes that although "[n]o one planned or directed of the organization of
economic life in any formal, overall way" the market overall was "orderly
and in many ways predictable."<a href="#10" class="footnote">10</a> For
Higgs, the central feature of the period was economic growth and he
describes this period as one of economic growth through transformation:
"changing patterns of demand; differing rates of productivity gain among
industries; and changing resource endowments among regions."<a href="#11" class="footnote">11</a>
Further, "to the extent that people fail to adjust to the economy's
transformed structure, economic growth is retarded."<a href="#12" class="footnote">12</a>
Individuals have little control over their destiny: they can either accept
market imperatives and participate in the economic growth or they can
reject them and risk being left behind. This is what Higgs' argument
amounts to, though he goes into greater detail about the activities of
the market forces.
</p>
<p>
Technological determinism similarly leaves individuals out of the
equation. It is the theory that innovation begets innovation. The early
innovations in textile manufacture led to improvements in power generation
which led to innovations in metallurgy. This group of innovations led to
the discovery of interchangeable parts and touched off a revolution in
manufacturing because of it. That led to railroad development which
spurred the iron and steel industries to greater heights of production.<a href="#13" class="footnote">13</a>
Historian Robert Fogel observes that the "process of innovation was
&hellip; continuous, so that practically every decade of the nineteenth
century produced important and far-reaching technological advances."<a href="#14" class="footnote">14</a>
Perhaps the best example of this view is historian David Landes, who
wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
The heart of the Industrial Revolution was an interrelated succession of
technological changes. The material advance took place in three areas:
&hellip; substitution of mechanical devices for human skills; &hellip;
inanimate power&mdash;in particular steam&mdash;took the place of human
and animal strength; &hellip; a marked improvement in the getting and
working of raw materials.<a href="#15" class="footnote">15</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
These new technologies required large amounts of capital both to procure
and maintain. This fact lead to innovations in business organization and
finance in order to provide it. Economic growth, then, was attributable to
a series of technological innovations, according to this view.
</p>
<p>
Both Marxism and determinism, popular as they may be, fail to fully
explain the causes and nature of American growth during the nineteenth
century. Marxism ignores the role of the entrepreneur because factories
don't make themselves. Workers can only take jobs in the factories because
an entrepreneur or group of entrepreneurs have raised the capital
necessary for its construction and concocted a business plan justifying
its existence. While workers are vital to production, their labor is not
the most fundamental: it is the entrepreneur's that counts most.
</p>
<p>
Determinism completely eliminates human agency&mdash;and that is its
failing. Technology does not develop naturally: it requires a human
inventor, human entrepreneurs to realize its potential, human engineers to
design machines to mass produce it, and human operators to work those
machines. Technology is definitely an important factor in explaining how
the Industrial Revolution produced the economic growth that it did, for it
would be impossible to have the Industrial Revolution without the
incredible productivity gains engendered by technology. Similarly, market
forces did not drive entrepreneurs to produce except insofar as each
entrepreneur discovered and calculated that he could do a better or less
expensive job producing a product than others. It is ludicrous to argue
that entrepreneurs were simply responding to market demands because
examples abound of industrialists who created vast empires where market
conditions were unfavorable.<a href="#16" class="footnote">16</a> It is
clear that individuals had important roles to perform in the prosecution
of the Industrial Revolution. What is not clear is what factor or factors
provided the impetus for the economic growth. We have ruled out worker
exploitation, technology, great men, geography, and market forces as
determinants. What's left?
</p>
<p>
Before we can fully answer that question, we must look at the nature of
the American Industrial Revolution. The revolution took place over the
course of the nineteenth century in two distinct phases, with the Civil
War serving as the transition point. The first phase begins in the 1840s
and ends at the start of the Civil War in 1861. The final phase begins
during the Civil War and ends around the turn of the century. There is
some overlap because the Civil War, though intensely disruptive and
destructive of commerce, did foster some business innovations out of
necessity. However one may demarcate the two phases, it is clear that
there are differences between them. In the coming pages, we will examine
each phase in more detail in order to illuminate these differences and
perhaps thereby come to a conclusion about the cause and catalyst of the
Industrial Revolution.
</p>
<p>
High growth characterized the first phase of the revolution.
Unfortunately, there are conflicting estimates about this growth because
explicit data about this growth are unavailable. The Bureau of the Census
did not collect manufacturing statistics until the 1850 Census and it
didn't break that data down by specific industries until the Census of
1880. For this reason, Simon Kuznets, Nobel Prize winner in economics,
considered Censuses prior to 1880 to be unreliable for analytical
purposes.<a href="#17" class="footnote">17</a> Other economists, such as
Robert E. Gallman, have made use of these intervening Censuses through
statistical extrapolation to divine growth statistics for the period.
Gallman examined two general measures of economic growth&mdash;total
commodity output and value added by manufacture<a href="#18" class="footnote">18</a>&mdash;and
found significant gains. Of total commodity output, he writes: "Between
1839 and 1899 total commodity output increased elevenfold&hellip;. Actual
rates varied fairly widely, high rates appearing during the decades ending
with 1854 and 1884, and a very low rate during the decade ending with
1869."<a href="#19" class="footnote">19</a> Of value added by manufacture:
"Gallman's series for value added in constant dollars of the purchasing
power of 1879 shows a rise of 157 per cent from 1839 to 1849; 76 per cent
from 1849 to 1859 &hellip;."<a href="#20" class="footnote">20</a>
</p>
<p>
Other measures of economic growth also support this characterization of
the period. Per capita gross national product between 1839 and 1859 rose
by 37%.<a href="#21" class="footnote">21</a> This meant a substantial
increase in the American people's standard of living. Exports rose from
$71.8 million in the 1830s to $144.4 million in the 1850s. Imports rose
from $62.7 million to $172.5 million for the same period.<a href="#22" class="footnote">22</a>
These indications of international trade indirectly show the vitality of
the American economy. Also, an average of 259,821 people per year
immigrated to America in the 1850s.<a href="#23" class="footnote">23</a>
Immigrants typically flock to prosperous nations. Perhaps the best way to
understand the nation's economic growth is to examine the expansion of two
vital industries: manufacturing and transportation.
</p>
<p>
Manufacturing is a very broad term denoting the production of goods from
raw materials. Data, as noted earlier, is sketchy overall. Measures of
coal output, pig iron production, and textile manufacture are available
and reliable, however. Coal's importance to economic growth cannot be
overemphasized. During the first half of the nineteenth century, power
came from only two sources: water and steam. Water was, by far, the poorer
source since a factory or mill had to be located adjacent to a fast moving
stream in order to capture its flow. A machine powered by steam could be
located anywhere, but steam requires an abundant source of energy to heat
the water. That source of energy was wood or charcoal, a wood byproduct,
until anthracite coal became available in the quantities necessary for
industrial purposes in the 1830s. Coal had the advantage of burning hotter
and longer than wood. By the mid-1840s, coal production had reached 2
million tons and the priced had dropped to $3 a ton (from close to $10 a
ton in the early 1830s).<a href="#24" class="footnote">24</a> By 1860,
coal production hit 14 million tons and America was importing an average
of 235,000 tons per year as well.<a href="#25" class="footnote">25</a>
</p>
<p>
The advent of coal spurred on the production of pig iron, which is crude
iron cast in blocks. In 1840, anthracite coal was used for the first time
to power a pig iron blast furnace. Sixty such furnaces were in operation
by 1849 and 121 by 1853. Forty-five percent of all pig iron was produced
using anthracite coal by 1854.<a href="#26" class="footnote">26</a> Pig
iron, though, is not something that a consumer wants. Iron only becomes
useful once it is made into wrought iron. With the availability of
inexpensive pig iron, wrought iron manufacturing enjoyed a renaissance of
sorts during this period. "Not only did the output of establishments
making axes, scythes, hoes, and plows increase, but for the first time the
fabricating and assembling of interchangeable parts became widely used in
making metal goods besides guns for the United States army," writes
historian Alfred D. Chandler Jr. "Locks, safes, clocks, and watches were
produced in large departmentalized factories." Chandler further notes that
the production of interchangeable parts required specialized machinery
which led to "the creation almost overnight of the American machine tool
industry."<a href="#27" class="footnote">27</a>
</p>
<p>
But coal wasn't just important for pig iron production. The availability
of an inexpensive fuel source increased the use of steam power. Factories
that previously had to rely on a nearby stream could relocate to more
propitious locations, closer to laborers and large markets. The textile
industry, in particular, benefited from steam-powered machines. From 1840
to 1860, the number of spindles in operation had more than doubled to 5.2
million.<a href="#28" class="footnote">28</a> Also, the number of bales of
cotton consumed in domestic manufacture rose 143% from 1840 to 1850 and
47% from 1850 to 1860.<a href="#29" class="footnote">29</a> This
development made it possible for "the factory to replace the artisans, the
small mill owners, and putting-out system as the basic unit of production
in many American industries."<a href="#30" class="footnote">30</a>
</p>
<p>
But economic growth didn't just happen in the manufacturing sector. In
fact, it was even more pronounced in the transportation arena. Prior to
1830, transportation was slow and erratic. Travel was primarily by horse
and boat. Both means of travel had incredible shortcomings: horses could
only pull so much and navigable waterways were not always convenient. The
latter issue was mitigated by the construction of canals to link towns and
waterways, although these canals froze over during the winter months. The
coming of the train changed all that. Transportation was no longer
constricted by terrain or climate considerations. The train could go
anywhere anytime&mdash;rapidly. The first transitional steps were hesitant
because of the significant entrenched interests in the form of turnpike,
canal, and stagecoach operators.<a href="#31" class="footnote">31</a> Even
though 3,000 miles of track had been laid by 1840, the railroads were
primarily used to connect commercial centers and to supplement waterways.
Roads were short, generally not over fifty miles in length.<a href="#32" class="footnote">32</a>
</p>
<p>
Things changed during the 1840s and 1850s. Technological improvements in
the production of locomotives, passenger cars, and rails in addition to
uniform standards in tracklaying led to the rapid development of the
nation's railroads. In 1850, there were 3,700 miles of canals&mdash;an
increase of 700 miles since 1840&mdash;while railroads had almost 9,000
miles of track.<a href="#33" class="footnote">33</a> During the 1850s,
they added an additional 21,000 miles of track.<a href="#34" class="footnote">34</a>
More importantly, trunk lines connecting the east with the west were built
by the giants of the industry: the Erie, the Baltimore and Ohio, the
Pennsylvania, and the New York Central. By 1860, the railroad had
displaced the waterways as the primary means of transportation for
everything except agricultural products and lumber.<a href="#35" class="footnote">35</a>
Passenger traffic rose from 90.1 million passenger miles in 1839 to 1.88
billion passenger miles in 1859; freight traffic increased even more: from
32.8 million ton-miles in 1839 to 2.58 billion ton-miles in 1859.<a href="#36" class="footnote">36</a>
</p>
<p>
This era also saw a high number of inventions and technological growth.
The annual number of patents stood at 544 in 1830, 993 in 1850, and 4,778
in 1860.<a href="#37" class="footnote">37</a> Some of the more notable
agricultural innovations were the steel plow in 1837, the grain elevator
in 1842, and the McCormick reaper in 1846.<a href="#38" class="footnote">38</a>
Iron-making inventions abounded as well. As noted earlier, the first
anthracite coal blast furnace was used to make pig iron in 1840. Heavy
iron rails were first successfully rolled in 1845.<a href="#39" class="footnote">39</a>
Other inventions that had profound effects were the telegraph, invented in
1832 but unused until 1844, and the sewing machine, invented in 1846 but
first mass produced by Isaac Singer in 1853.<a href="#40" class="footnote">40</a>
The telegraph made instantaneous communications possible and enabled
railroads to coordinate traffic; the sewing machine destroyed the
home-based clothing industry&mdash;workers could operate sewing machines
in factories where managers could control quality and production.
</p>
<p>
The economy changed during this period on the microeconomic scale as well
as the macroeconomic scale that we've been discussing. Individual
businesses, with a few exceptions, tended to be specialized in their aims,
fairly small, and managed by their owners. Specialization developed over
time as production separated from distribution, which separated from
marketing. For example, "an iron furnace of the 1850s normally made only
pig (cast) iron; it did not convert the cast iron into semi-finished
wrought iron or into finished products such as nails or hardware."<a href="#41" class="footnote">41</a>
Similarly, "an ironmaster of 1850 would simply turn over the marketing of
pig iron to a separate businessman (an iron merchant like Baltimore's
Enoch Pratt) who sold the goods and charged the ironmaster for his
services."<a href="#42" class="footnote">42</a> In the agricultural
sector, the network of commodities dealers came into existence around this
time. Commodities dealers dealt with what are today called "futures"&mdash;the
purchase and sale of the anticipated product of future harvests. On the
manufacturing side, we see the distinction drawn between wholesale and
retail by merchant houses, who further specialized by handling one
particular variety of goods. The merchant houses sold their wares to
jobbers, whose role was to market to the thousands of retail
establishments around the country.<a href="#43" class="footnote">43</a>
These arrangements enabled manufacturers to reach markets that they could
not have reached before due to a lack of resources.
</p>
<p>
They lacked these resources because their operations tended, with a few
exceptions, to be small. The largest American industrial firm at the end
of the period under consideration was the Pepperell textile mill. It
employed around 800 people&mdash;puny by today's standards.<a href="#44" class="footnote">44</a>
Most manufacturers had little in the way of physical plant or machinery.
Alexis de Tocqueville noted in the 1830s that "what most astonishe[d]
[him] in the United States [was] not so much the marvelous grandeur of
some undertakings, as the innumerable multitudes of small ones."<a href="#45" class="footnote">45</a>
Even iron furnaces had in 1849, on average, around eighty workers and an
average capitalization of $83,000&mdash;much smaller than one would expect
given the quantities of iron they produced.<a href="#46" class="footnote">46</a>
They were small because they tended to be financed by a single person or
by several people in partnership. Historian Robert Higgs argues that "most
businessmen conducted their affairs within small and highly localized
markets, and therefore proprietorships and partnerships predominated."<a href="#47" class="footnote">47</a>
The limits of capital for one person or a handful of people are pretty
substantial. This small capitalization, though, encouraged Americans to
enter into business. "The fact that it was easy to enter business nurtured
the belief that the society was open and fluid, that this was a land of
opportunity," notes historian Glenn Porter. "The goods most men bought
were made and sold by small businesses, and because the capital
requirements for most businesses were small, people could easily dream of
owning and operating their own establishments."<a href="#48" class="footnote">48</a>
</p>
<p>
Management of these small businesses was informal and generally performed
by the owners and partners. The Pepperell textile mill mentioned earlier
could still be "toured and understood by a single manager in a matter of a
few hours," even though it was the largest American industrial firm.<a href="#49" class="footnote">49</a>
The managerial hierarchy as we know it today simply did not exist.
Salaried managers were employed at the large textile firms, but at few
other places. Porter characterized the management of these small
businesses thusly:
</p>
<blockquote>
Relationships between owner-managers and their workers were also quite
personal. Because the manager saw his few employees frequently and lived
with them in the same town, he could at least be expected to know their
names, the quality of their work, and perhaps even some things about their
personal lives.<a href="#50" class="footnote">50</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
We get a picture of a management not entirely different from the earlier
system of masters and apprentices. The owners were the managers and they
had a developed affinity with their workers.
</p>
<p>
The exceptions mentioned earlier to this smallness were the textile mills
and the railroads. The average number of spindles per textile mill, for
example, increased from less than 500 in 1815 to 2,000 in 1840 and 5,000
in 1860.<a href="#51" class="footnote">51</a> During the 1840s, there were
forty-one textile mills capitalized at over $250,000.<a href="#52" class="footnote">52</a>
The textile mills bigness, as impressive as it is compared to other
enterprises, was dwarfed by the railroads. Railway investment went from
$172.3 million in the 1840s to $737.3 million in the 1850s to over $1.1
billion by 1859.<a href="#53" class="footnote">53</a> By 1860, there were
numerous railroads capitalized at over $10 million and several at over $20
million.<a href="#54" class="footnote">54</a> We will discuss the special
case of the railroads in due course since they transcended the two phases
of the American Industrial Revolution.
</p>
<p>
The second phase of the American Industrial Revolution began soon after
the Civil War. If the first phase was characterized by high economic
growth, we can call the second a period of extreme economic growth. Per
capita gross national product rose at an average annual rate of 2%. Real
gross national product grew at an annual average rate of 4%.<a href="#55" class="footnote">55</a>
As noted earlier, two useful measures of economic growth&mdash;total
commodity output and value added by manufacture&mdash;reflect this
impressive growth. Economist Robert Gallman notes that "between 1839 and
1899 total commodity output increased elevenfold&hellip;. Actual rates
varied fairly widely, high rates appearing during the decades ending with
1854 and 1884, and a very low rate during the decade ending with 1869."<a href="#56" class="footnote">56</a>
Gallman found that the value added in constant dollars of the purchasing
power of 1879 had risen 82% from 1869 to 1879 and 112% from 1879 to 1889.<a href="#57" class="footnote">57</a>
To illustrate the dramatic increase, Robert Higgs compares America's
progress to other advanced industrial nations: "In 1870, after several
decades of industrial growth, the United States had a manufacturing output
equal to that of France and Germany combined, but only about three fourths
as large as that of the United Kingdom; by 1913 the American manufacturing
output equaled that of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom combined!"<a href="#58" class="footnote">58</a>
This land of opportunity attracted a total of more than 28 million
immigrants between 1865 and 1915.<a href="#59" class="footnote">59</a>
</p>
<p>
Manufacturing's portion of total output during this period rose from 33%
in 1869 to 53% in 1899 precisely because of this economic growth.<a href="#60" class="footnote">60</a>
In order to best illustrate the differences between the two phases of the
revolution, we will try to focus on the same areas of manufacturing,
transportation, and technology where possible. Unfortunately, this cannot
be done exactly since industries were created during the second phase that
didn't exist in the first and some industries present in the first had
been replaced or displaced by the second.<a href="#61" class="footnote">61</a>
</p>
<p>
One of those that was displaced in the second half of the nineteenth
century was the pig iron industry. Although production increased 100% from
1865 to 1870 and 130% from 1870 to 1880, iron's utility was waning in the
face of competition from cheap steel.<a href="#62" class="footnote">62</a>
When Carnegie entered the steel business in 1872, the Bessemer steelmaking
process was introduced into the United States in the late 1860s and early
1870s. Carnegie's Edgar Thomson Works in Pittsburgh was built entirely
along the Bessemer process, one of the few steel mills to do so.<a href="#63" class="footnote">63</a>
Through the use of this process and the advent of the open-hearth furnace,
steel production soared from 70,000 tons in 1870 and over four million
tons in 1890 to twelve million tons in 1900.<a href="#64" class="footnote">64</a>
By the 1890s, Carnegie's Pittsburgh steel operations were outproducing
Great Britain's entire steel industry by 700,000 tons annually!<a href="#65" class="footnote">65</a>
</p>
<p>
This period also saw the implementation of the factory system in sectors
that had traditionally been labor-intensive. U.S. Commission of Labor
Carroll Wright characterized this rapid increase of the factory system in
his 1880 introduction to the special report on manufacturing in that
year's Census:
</p>
<blockquote>
Of the nearly three millions of people employed in the mechanical
industries of this country at least four-fifths are working under the
factory system. Some of the other remarkable instances of the application
of the system [besides those in textiles] are to be found in the
manufacture of boots and shoes, of watches, musical instruments, clothing,
agricultural implements, metallic goods generally, fire-arms, carriages
and wagons, wooden goods, rubber goods, and even the slaughtering of hogs.
Most of these industries have been brought under the factory system during
the past thirty years.<a href="#66" class="footnote">66</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
One outstanding example of this recent mechanization can be found in the
manufacture of cigarettes. Traditionally, cigarettes had been made by hand
throughout the manufacturing process. In 1881, cigarette-making machines
were introduced. By the mid-1880s, one machine could produce 120,000
cigarettes a day&mdash;dizzying when compared to the capacity of the most
highly skilled hand workers, who could produce perhaps 3,000 cigarettes a
day. The adoption of similar machinery revolutionized the match, soap, and
grain-milling industries during the 1880s and 1890s.<a href="#67" class="footnote">67</a>
</p>
<p>
If the gains made by manufacturers were impressive, but those made by the
railroads were stunning. This period saw the completion of the first
transcontinental railroad in 1869 and subsequent transcontinentals in
1882, two in 1883, and one in 1893.<a href="#68" class="footnote">68</a>
Total mileage expanded from 52,922 in 1870 to 166,703 in 1890.<a href="#69" class="footnote">69</a>
Passenger and freight traffic reached ever-climbing heights: 7.7 billion
passenger miles in 1882 and 12.5 billion passenger miles by 1890; 39.3
billion and 79.2 billion ton-miles in 1882 and 1890, respectively.<a href="#70" class="footnote">70</a>
Railroad capitalization also soared from $2.5 billion in 1870 to $10.1
billion in 1890.<a href="#71" class="footnote">71</a> In the 1870s, the
Pennsylvania Railroad alone issued $78 million in securities to help
finance its expansion.<a href="#72" class="footnote">72</a> That expansion
must have produced the desired results since Pennsylvania Railroad freight
locomotives hauled an average of 5.1 million ton-miles per year in 1881,
up from 2.1 million ton-miles in 1870.<a href="#73" class="footnote">73</a>
</p>
<p>
These numbers are only a shadow of the economic impact wrought by the
railroads. In 1880, three-fourths of America's steel output went into the
production of rails. The amount of coal required to power the nation's
31,812 locomotives was staggering and inestimable. It is estimated that
road construction and maintenance consumed over 71 million railroad ties
in 1889-90 alone!<a href="#74" class="footnote">74</a>  The railroads also
used large quantities of machine tools, copper, glass, India rubber, felt,
and animal and mineral oils.<a href="#75" class="footnote">75</a> The
secondary or indirect benefits produced by the railroads is incalculable.
Since they brought down the costs of transportation, they reduced the cost
of manufactured goods. Since they offered reliable transportation and
refrigerated cars, they brought produce and livestock to a national
market. By enabling rapid postal delivery and granting rights-of-way to
the telegraph companies, they enabled nearly instantaneous
transcontinental communication. There can be no disagreement about the
importance of the railroads to economic growth during the latter half of
the nineteenth century.
</p>
<p>
The second phase of the American Industrial Revolution witnessed an
incredible growth in technological innovation and invention as well. In
the 1870s, as noted earlier, roller grinding was adopted in grain mills.<a href="#76" class="footnote">76</a>
The telephone also was introduced during that period.<a href="#77" class="footnote">77</a>
The street car was invented in 1871 and entered into use in 1873.<a href="#78" class="footnote">78</a>
The air brake came into widespread use in 1872 and the automatic coupler
did in 1874.<a href="#79" class="footnote">79</a> Electric power became
available with the advent of the dynamo and the Edison central power
system in 1881 and 1882, even though electric arc lighting was invented in
1878 and Edison developed the incandescent light bulb in 1879.<a href="#80" class="footnote">80</a>
Finally, the electric welding machine's invention in 1886 enabled the
joining of metal without rivets.<a href="#81" class="footnote">81</a>
</p>
<p>
The revolution in manufacturing and technology also extended to a
revolution in business organization. This second phase was dominated by
business integrations, both vertical and horizontal. Vertical integration
occurs when a business expands its operations from production into
distribution, marketing, and raw-material production. The best example of
vertical integration is Carnegie Steel, the huge steelmaker mentioned
earlier. In the 1870s, Carnegie bought firms in order to gain access to
the raw materials that they produced. He bought the Unity and the Larimer
Coke works, the Scotia Ore mines, and a ferro-manganese mine in an effort
to get at the coke and iron ore he so desperately needed.<a href="#82" class="footnote">82</a>
In the 1880s and 1890s, he gained control of the Henry C. Frick Coke
Company, the prodigious Mesabi iron ore range, and many limestone
quarries. In order to transport these raw materials, Carnegie bought a
fleet of Great Lakes ore steamships and created a railroad of
approximately one thousand miles of track. He founded mills to produce
finished steel products like structural steel and rails in addition to the
creation of sales outlets to market Carnegie's products.<a href="#83" class="footnote">83</a>
James Bridge, in his 1903 book entitled <cite>Inside History of the
Carnegie Steel Company</cite>, noted that "from the moment these crude
stuffs were dug out of the earth until they flowed in a stream of liquid
steel in the ladles, there was never a price, profit, or royalty paid to
an outsider."<a href="#84" class="footnote">84</a>
</p>
<p>
Another vertically integrated enterprise was Gustavus Swift and Company.
Swift and Company was a meatpacking operation of nationwide scale that
made extensive use of the railroads and telegraph. Before Swift, most
cattle were shipped alive to towns near where the meat was to be consumed.
This was inefficient because although only 40% of the meat was edible,
100% of the cow had to be shipped to the slaughterhouse.<a href="#85" class="footnote">85</a>
Swift bought cattle from the western ranches and then slaughtered them in
six packing plants in cities near the frontier. There they were dressed
and shipped via refrigerated car to Swift's branch houses around the
nation. These branch houses were Swift's master stroke. Each branch house
had its own refrigerated storage space and a sales staff to sell the beef.<a href="#86" class="footnote">86</a>
The only hurdle Swift had to overcome was consumer resistance to
purchasing meat that wasn't slaughtered locally. He overcame this
opposition by selling quality meat at prices that substantially undercut
those of the local butcher.<a href="#87" class="footnote">87</a> The
vertical integration enjoyed by Carnegie Steel and Swift and Company
enabled these companies to be "independent of the general market," as
Carnegie himself put it.<a href="#88" class="footnote">88</a> Vertical
integration rendered them less affected by swings in the price or
availability of raw inputs.
</p>
<p>
The other type of integration&mdash;horizontal&mdash;sought to control raw
materials and distribution by purchase or integration with other firms in
the same industry in order to realize economies of scale. By requiring
such massive quantities of raw material and producing such massive
quantities of finished goods, firms possessing horizontal integration made
themselves a force to be reckoned with, thus allowing them considerable
bargaining power. The quintessential example of horizontal integration is
the largest industrial concern of the time, Standard Oil. Standard Oil
started in 1867 when John D. Rockefeller acquired his first oil refinery
in Cleveland, Ohio. Oil refining was a very competitive industry: there
were many refiners and none of them could affect the market price of oil.
These refiners did not particularly like this competition, which they
(like many businessmen of the time) deemed ruinous. In 1882, Rockefeller
and forty other oil refiners entered into a trust agreement whereby they
turned over their common stock to nine trustees in return for dividends
from the trust.<a href="#89" class="footnote">89</a> Standard Oil wasn't
perfectly horizontal since it owned some supplies of crude oil and the
pipelines to transport it. By the 1890s, Standard Oil controlled over 90%
of the oil refining capacity in the United States.<a href="#90" class="footnote">90</a>
As Chandler expressed the power of horizontal integration:
</p>
<blockquote>
The transformation of a loose alliance of manufacturing or marketing firms
into a single consolidated organization with a central headquarters made
possible economies of scale through standardization of processes and
standardization in the procurement of materials. Of more significance,
consolidation permitted a concentration of production in a few large
favorably located factories. By handling a high volume of output,
consolidated factories reduced the cost of making each individual unit.
They could specialize further and subdivide the process of manufacturing
and also were often able to develop and apply new technological
improvements more easily than could smaller units.<a href="#91" class="footnote">91</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
These different forms of integration as well as the growing complexity of
the organization required changes in the business structure. After the
Civil War, corporations became the predominant form of business
organization. The development of markets for corporate securities
certainly created an incentive for incorporation since the division of
ownership into readily transferable shares combined with formal markets
for those shares allowed businesses to raise money for expansion through
issuance of securities.<a href="#92" class="footnote">92</a> Other changes
to the business structure included a more formalized managerial hierarchy.
Porter argues that "a hallmark of the modern business enterprise was its
separation of ownership and control."<a href="#93" class="footnote">93</a>
As businesses grew more complex (and one can easily surmise the complexity
of producing the economic growth mentioned elsewhere in this essay), they
required the services of professional, full-time managers. Lower levels of
managers could specialize in understanding and controlling one or two
aspects of the corporation. Middle managers above them could supervise a
few lower-level managers and top managers could supervise one or two
middle managers. Information and control was thus transferred up the
corporate hierarchy until supreme decision-making authority was vested in
the president of the corporation, who typically owned very little stock in
the company. To be sure, final authority resided with the Board of
Directors. However, the Board of Directors typically represented the
investment bankers and financiers and they tended to not delve into the
operational side of management.<a href="#94" class="footnote">94</a>
</p>
<p>
We have now adequately presented the facts regarding the two phases of the
American Industrial Revolution and we can now draw conclusions. Although
they share some traits in common, it is clear that they are very
different. The most significant differences between them are the higher
rate of economic growth and the more sophisticated business structures in
the second phase. It is my contention that the former is explained by the
latter. The more complex organization enabled opportunities for growth to
be realized. The earlier period had many of the same opportunities, but
without the expertise and specialization inherent in a professional
managerial hierarchy businesses just cannot expand as much. Let's be
clear, I am not saying that technology was unimportant. Quite the
contrary, I believe that technology was vital to the successful
prosecution of the Industrial Revolution. However, technology would have
been unavailable were it not for the efforts of entrepreneurs and managers
in mass producing it. Likewise, I fully recognize the importance of
capital markets and the greater availability of capital in the latter half
of the nineteenth century as contributing factors to the economic growth.
But capital does not make a factory work or organize complex production
processes. These still require human thought, as exemplified by managers.
</p>
<p>
The "visible hand" of management, as Chandler put it, directed and
orchestrated all aspects of production. This role came into existence
during the second phase of the revolution. Although there did exist some
managers before 1850, the position did not come into its own until after
the Civil War. The multiunit business did not exist in the United States
in 1840. The railroad, with its need for the safe, efficient movement of
passengers and freight, required administrative coordination across
business units and was the first truly big business in America.<a href="#95" class="footnote">95</a>
In manufacturing, modern management came about when technology allowed the
factory system to be implemented. Output rose as machinery, plant design,
and administrative procedures were improved by management.<a href="#96" class="footnote">96</a>
</p>
<p>
Once managers had administrative control of the production flows, they
sought to grow the business in order to assure its continued success and
existence. Their motivations for doing so were both defensive and
productive.<a href="#97" class="footnote">97</a> As we have seen with the
vertical and horizontal integration of businesses, business expansion
could stabilize and rationalize productive processes&mdash;as in the case
of Carnegie Steel where vertical integration allowed Carnegie's steel
mills to operate at full capacity by insuring adequate supply of raw
materials or in the case of Standard Oil where horizontal integration
allowed the trust to realize economies of scale by enlarging the oil
refining capacity. Defensive expansion was most seen in the railroads.
The construction of competing lines in already saturated markets arose
from the need of the railroad to build great transportation systems. Once
the business expanded, further expansion was made easier because the
facilities and skills generated by the expansion were easily transferred
to new functions.
</p>
<p>
These growth motivations by managers go far in explaining the incredible
economic growth of the late nineteenth century and the rationalization of
the production process goes the rest of the way. As philosopher Ayn Rand
put it, "managerial work&mdash;the organization and integration of human
effort into purposeful, large-scale, long-range activities&mdash;is, in
the realm of action, what man's conceptual faculty is in the realm of
cognition."<a href="#98">98</a> This comparison to the mind is no
accident, for that is precisely what managers embody in the economy&mdash;rational
thought organizing process flows and strategically planning future
expansion. The managerial revolution can properly be understood as the
catalyst driving the American Industrial Revolution.

Interestingly, the Erie Canal operators persuaded the New York state
legislature in 1833 to prohibit any railroad in the state from carrying
freight. In 1844, an amendment was added allowing railroads to carry
freight when the canal was inoperable (frozen over) and, incredibly, the
restrictions weren't lifted until 1851.

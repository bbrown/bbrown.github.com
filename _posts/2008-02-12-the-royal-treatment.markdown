Apparently, Prince Andrew is <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/business/articles/0211biz-talker0212-ON.html" title="Look at the second to the last paragraph: we're considering an expansion into the UK?!?!">visiting my workplace</a> today. They've cordoned off a huge swath of the parking lot and there's some signs for media parking, so I expect it's going to be a zoo. I'm really not a fan of monarchy, but it's pretty exciting for such a high-profile visit. It sure beats <a href="http://bbrown.info/2006/10/27/blowhard.aspx">J.D. Hayworth</a>.</p>

[UPDATE (2/14/2008): Here's the <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/community/gilbert/articles/0212sr-godaddy0213-ON.html">definitive article</a> on the matter with a photo of our president looking thoughtful and the prince looking quite princely&#x2014;at least that's how I'd imagine a prince to look.]

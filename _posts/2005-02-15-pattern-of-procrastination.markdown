<br />Long-time readers will know that I am slowly moving my sites from <a href="http://www.uplinkearth.com" title="Great ColdFusion host, but I want to move to PHP">UplinkEarth</a> to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/" title="The kick-assingest host I've ever found!">DreamHost</a>&#x2014;way too slowly, in fact, since I am paying $29.90/month for one and $19.95/month for the other&#x2014;and simultaneously trying to set up a <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> to handle everything.<br /><br />I've <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/wordpress-limitations.cfm">flitted about</a> between different systems, liking this feature of one but this feature of another one. Last year, I finally decided to go with <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/">TextPattern</a>. TXP, as its called, is an excellent CMS that implements separation of content from presentation and a page model that sits well with me. When I decided on it back in October, I was floored by how much better of an implementation it was than anything else out there (and I evaluated at least a dozen CMSs and perhaps five seriously).<br /><br />I really liked WordPress, but it didn't meet my needs as a blogger and an essayist. There's just so many different types of content at the Bill Brown Information Center that WordPress's one-admin-per-blog and one-blog-per-directory limitations were too much. In fact, I ended up using it for <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/">Found on the Web</a> and I couldn't be happier with it.<br /><br />We're now halfway through February and TextPattern's 1.0 release has been <a href="http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=5173">delayed repeatedly</a> with the last announced release date being January 10th, 2005. I can't wait forever for what could end up being a third release candidate bundled up as 1.0. In the meantime, WordPress released <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changelog/1.5">version 1.5</a> and the new version offers static pages, a major requirement of bbrown.info.<br /><br />Do I remain in limbo waiting for a <a href="http://www.textism.com/">single developer in France</a> to decide to finish up the 1.0 release and risk finding out that it's the same as the 1.0rc2 that's out there with a few bugfixes? Or do I prepare the migration of bbrown to WordPress with its several developers, active development, and vibrant community, hacking in what bits don't fit?<br /><br />The decision seems pretty clear, doesn't it?<br /><br /><br />

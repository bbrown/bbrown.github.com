<br />Still printing out your digital pictures like a sucker? <a href="http://www.walmart.com/">Wal-Mart</a> offers digital photography printing for 29&#xA2; per 4" by 6" print. You bring in a CD or your flash memory card, select the pictures you want to print (or print them all like we did), and they're ready in an hour. They print them on Fuji Film paper and the quality is as good as a conventional photograph. I think printing out a digital picture yourself probably costs more than that in paper and ink, easily.<br /><br /><br />

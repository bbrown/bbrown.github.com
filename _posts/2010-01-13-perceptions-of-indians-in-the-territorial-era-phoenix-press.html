<p>
Our perceptions of the perception of Indians in the Old West are colored
by countless movies depicting Westerners as Indian haters, innumerable
books positioning the Indian as noble victim of white depredations, and
threadbare stereotypes confirming the progression of a century. Like the
reexamination of Anglo-Indian relations in the Southwest that took place
decades ago, it is high time for another look. That previous scholarly
exercise attacked the then-pervasive stereotype engendered by the Western
movie: the Indian on the warpath. It showed that Indian culture was much
richer and vivacious than the movies and other superficial dramatizations
let on. We began to see the richness of the many tribes and,
simultaneously, to appreciate the frustrations and disappointments they
experienced in their dealings with the Americans.
</p>
<p>
This reexamination also fostered a vilification of these same Americans.
The pioneers of the Southwest come across as cutthroat bigots bent on
decimation of the Indian civilization, displacement from their sacred
lands, and subjugation of the people under the heavy boot of the military.
The revisionists hold the massacre at Wounded Knee and countless other
atrocities as representative of Anglo avarice, which saw the Indian as an
impediment to the Manifest Destiny. They believe that the subtext (and
sometimes overt motivation) for all of these deplorable actions is
racism&mdash;an outright hatred for the Indians. Popular movies like
<cite>Dances with Wolves</cite> spread awareness of this subtext wider and
more effectively than any of the dozens of academic treatments.
</p>
<p>
But has the pendulum swung too far? Where once American culture was guilty
of nearsightedness towards the society, is it not now similarly guilty of
myopia towards its ancestors, the pioneers? Is the current conception of
the pioneers as murderous double-crossers not as two-dimensional as the
past notion of Indians as whooping, scalping savages? American
civilization in the latter half of the nineteenth century was far more
advanced than many modern Americans realize. Most of the household goods
that we now consider staples and necessities were invented in that period
and most of the institutions on which we rely were devised and developed
during that time. For us to deprecate and denounce our heritage is a grave
injustice&mdash;worse possibly than the original injustice to which this
was a reaction. The Americans of the late nineteenth century are largely
responsible for the positioning of the United States as an economic
superpower; we owe them, in large part, our good fortune and economic
opportunities.
</p>
<p>
To be sure, racism was prevalent in America of the nineteenth century. The
history of slavery and of racist federal policies bears this out. In fact,
many of the settlers of the Southwest did hate Indians. The important
question, though, is how permeated by racism was American culture. Did it
inform every aspect of American life or was it confined to a minority? It
is truly difficult to answer such a question with any amount of certainty.
There did not exist the modern polling apparatus and its attendant ability
to gauge public opinion. Study of individual correspondence carries with
it the definite possibility of unrepresentative sampling. Discerning
public opinions on the subject of Indians would be well nigh impossible
were it not for the Western newspapers.
</p>
<p>
Newspapers are useful for their insights into public opinion. They led
public opinion while they reflected it. Newspapers provided a means of
focusing the public's attention on a particular matter and either
polarizing or unifying the public's views. What's more, nearly every town
in the Old West had one and many had several. That means that most of the
population was covered by and exposed to newspapers. There are few other
resources available that offer that breadth of coverage. In the East, the
research question gets easier because there are larger newspapers with
more reporters as well as well-established institutions producing
voluminous records. Out on the frontier, the only entity that could be
relied on to keep such copious records was the United States
military&mdash;an Eastern institution transported West. As David Dary
pointed out in his book <cite>Red Blood and Black Ink</cite>, the
newspapers of the West reflected "the total image of their towns and
cities" and provided "community life with cohesion and direction and
purpose by agitating, by creating demands, and by establishing and
preserving standards of public morals." <a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a>
</p>
<p>
The fact that newspapers were always unsated in their appetite for news is
invaluable in considering the public perception of Indians in the West.
The desperate need to fill a four- to six-page broadside every day of the
week meant that the harried editor would print anything. Fortunately, even
the most trivial events received comment or publication. Careful and
watchful digging through old newspapers yields innumerable articles on
Indians, Indian policy, and Indian customs. Analyzing it with the benefit
of a complete archive, a diligent historian can find in the trends thus
inspected much buried treasure. By encompassing several competing
newspapers in the investigation, the historian can weed out prejudices and
more capably discern public opinion. In a city with several newspapers,
several perspectives are given for any particular event&mdash;a veritable
gold mine for the historian.
</p>
<p>
Phoenix, for example, had many newspapers during the latter half of the
nineteenth century. It is difficult to obtain an exact count since some
were ephemeral in the extreme, but <cite>The Arizona Republican</cite> was
founded in 1890 at a time when there were two dailies already in
circulation and several other weeklies.<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a>
<cite>The Arizona Republican</cite> had the largest circulation in town
and continues publication through to the present. Its major competitor was
the <cite>Phoenix Daily Herald</cite>, which it bought in 1899. Other
principals in Phoenix journalism included <cite>The Enterprise</cite>
(later <cite>The Daily Enterprise</cite>), the <cite>Arizona
Gazette</cite>, and the <cite>Arizona Democrat</cite>. Inclusion of the
outlying towns brought the <cite>Tempe News</cite> and the <cite>Mesa Free
Press</cite>.
</p>
<p>
Phoenix was also situated adjacent to two major Indian reservations: the
Salt River and Gila River Reservations, joint homes of the Pima and the
Maricopa. These two tribes made for a unique situation in Phoenix in that
they were friendly to the Americans and antagonists to the Apache tribes.
Given their proximity to Phoenix, their presence was constantly felt.
Farmers like the majority of the local population, they traded their wheat
crops for goods and services. There are several other tribes near to
Phoenix such as the Ak-Chin, the Yavapai, and the Tohono O'odham, but
their influence and impact in the Salt River Valley was negligible
compared to the two nearer tribes.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, there are limits to the amount of research possible for an
essay of this scope. Choices have to be made about the nature and
selection of sources examined. The tribes thus must be pared down to the
Pimas and the Maricopas for the reasons just enumerated. The selection of
newspapers is more difficult. Daily newspapers publish 365 editions each
year; multiply that by about six pages per issue and an average of 25
years in the period under consideration and the result is nearly 55,000
pages of copy to review&mdash;and that's for a single newspaper. For the
purposes of this essay, the newspapers selected are <cite>The Arizona
Republican</cite>, the <cite>Arizona Gazette</cite>, and the <cite>Phoenix
Daily Herald</cite>. Newspapers from the outlying areas like the
<cite>Tempe News</cite> could not be included due to the difficulty in
procuring them as well as the horrible condition of the <cite>Tempe
News</cite>' microfilm. The three papers chosen represent the large
majority of Phoenix's newspaper circulation for the period as well as the
most influential journals of the time. Due to time constraints, years of
each were picked at random and reviewed day by day. If an article or
snippet mentioned Indians in any capacity, it was earmarked for review and
tabulation. Ninety articles spanning the years 1880, 1885, 1890, 1891, and
1892 were thus cataloged.
</p>
<p>
Ninety articles spanning five different years from three newspapers
represents a fraction of the information stored in the Phoenix newspapers.
However, it does represent a sizable enough sample to draw some
conclusions about the local perceptions of Indians in territorial-era
Phoenix&mdash;conclusions that may or may not be born out by future and
further research. Surprisingly, the Phoenix press&mdash;and presumably the
general population&mdash;suffered from little of the Indian-hating
conventionally associated with frontier populations. Despite a number of
references to "savages" and the "red devils," the Phoenix newspapers were
predominantly tolerant of Indians in general and the nearby tribes in
particular. Their pleas for the Phoenix Indian School and the civilization
of the Indians underscored a concern for their fellow Salt River Valley
inhabitants. Though it may strike many modern ears as patronizing, these
calls for civilization were made with the best of intentions and
represented a reaching out to others whose status seemed degraded.
</p>
<p>
Before dissecting the articles themselves, it is instructive to meet the
principals described and describing therein. First, we will briefly touch
on what Phoenix looked like during the period. Then, we will give some
background about the presses and the editors running them. Finally, we
will discuss the Pima and Maricopa Indians. Such a familiarization with
the entities involved will provide the reader with a starting context for
understanding the articles.
</p>
<p>
Phoenix was created from the remnants of the Hohokam Indian civilization,
which had disappeared around 1400. Ruins of the civilization remained and
it was the irrigation ditches those people had created that inspired John
"Jack" Swilling with the agricultural possibilities of the Salt River
Valley in November 1867. Swilling, a freighter for the U.S. Army, saw the
long-abandoned ditches and organized the Swilling Irrigating and Canal
Company with money from Wickenburg residents. His goal was to farm the
rich soil and make money through supplying Camp McDowell&mdash;a nearby
fort that served Prescott, Wickenburg, and the mining camps of central
Arizona.<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a> By 1870, his company's
efforts had attracted a population of 235 and put more than 1,500 acres
under cultivation.<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a>  This led to calls
for formalization of the settlement, which was effected on October 26,
1870 and the name of Phoenix was chosen for the new town.<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a>
The town had a great deal of promise, heightened by its selection as the
county seat of the newly-formed Maricopa County in 1871.<a href="#6" class="footnote">6</a>
</p>
<p>
The 1870s turned out to be a good time for the future Valley of the Sun.
Local entrepreneurs built two new canals, whose water supported the new
homesteaders brought out by the Desert Land Act of 1877 which expanded the
settler's allotment from 160 to 640 acres. Brick and wood buildings began
to replace the early adobe structures. Boasting several
one-hundred-foot-wide streets, an ice factory, a deluxe hotel, and a
bustling commercial center, Phoenix was home to 1,708 residents at the
census taking of 1880, who contemplated and ratified incorporation at the
end of the decade.<a href="#7" class="footnote">7</a> Its star was on the
rise in the Arizona Territory, a fact announced incessantly by the first
area newspaper <cite>The Salt River Valley Herald</cite>.
</p>
<p>
The town's population nearly doubled during the next decade, up to 3,152
in the census of 1890.<a href="#8" class="footnote">8</a> The completion
of the Maricopa and Phoenix Railroad in 1887 marked the fledgling town's
entrance into the national market as the town's agricultural products
steamed out onto the Southern Pacific's main line in Maricopa, Arizona.
The agriculture of the Valley got a boost and was ready for the extension
with the development of the forty-mile long Arizona Canal in 1885. This
canal brought 80,000 additional acres under cultivation and required more
capital than the small town could muster.<a href="#9" class="footnote">9</a>
These and other achievements spurred the population increase as well as
the movement of the territorial capital in January 1889. Phoenix was
beginning to look like what local leaders hoped would be "the Denver of
the Southwest" and "the future metropolis of the territory."<a href="#10" class="footnote">10</a>
</p>
<p>
A second rail connection was added in 1895, this time to the Atchison,
Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad which passed through Prescott.<a href="#11" class="footnote">11</a>
This new line provided competition for the Southern Pacific line and
established Phoenix as a railroad hub for the central Arizona region. More
importantly, at least to the community's boosters, it added to that
intangible edifice they were building: the town's prestige.
</p>
<p>
By 1896, the cultivated land in the Salt River Valley had grown to 127,512
acres.<a href="#12" class="footnote">12</a> A severe drought came soon
after and led to the formation in 1903 of the Salt River Valley Water
Users' Association, the forerunner to the modern Salt River Project. Its
main goal was to lobby the federal government to construct surplus water
storage in order to mediate future droughts. A site was surveyed at the
junction of the Salt River and Tonto Creek for the construction of a dam,
the costs of which would be repaid by the members of the SRVWUA. The
location so impressed the federal officials that they decided to make the
Roosevelt Dam the first project for the recently passed Reclamation Act of
1902.<a href="#13" class="footnote">13</a> The dam was completed in 1911
and ushered in a new era of prosperity for Valley farmers. Phoenix
experienced a population boom as promoters spread information about the
Valley's advantages nationwide: 5,544 in 1900 and 11,134 in 1910. Those
figures, however, mask the real population growth since farmers were not
counted in the town's population. Maricopa County's population, which did
encompass the farmers, had grown from 9,998 in 1890 to 20,457 in 1900 to
34,485 in 1910.<a href="#14" class="footnote">14</a>
</p>
<p>
The town had also expanded in size during the territorial era. Situated in
the geographic center of the 40-mile-long, 15-mile-wide Salt River Valley,
Phoenix had plenty of room to grow and spread.<a href="#15" class="footnote">15</a>
Streetcars and the automobile enabled Valley residents to push the town's
boundaries out further and further. From the original townsite of 0.5
square mile in 1870, Phoenix had grown to 3.2 square miles in 1913 through
annexation and growth.<a href="#16" class="footnote">16</a> The building
of the Center (Central) Street bridge over the Salt River opens areas
south of Phoenix to development and farming. All of these efforts enabled
the area under cultivation to rebound back to 126,717 acres in 1909 after
the drought had dropped it down to 96,863 acres in 1905.<a href="#17" class="footnote">17</a>
</p>
<p>
In the midst of all of this growth, newspapers were there to chronicle it
all and to spread the word. As already mentioned, the first newspaper, the
<cite>Salt River Valley Herald</cite>, was established in January 1878 as
a weekly publication. Soon after its inception, its editor N.A. Morford
increased the schedule to become the Valley's first daily, changing the
name at the same time to the <cite>Phoenix Daily Herald</cite> to reflect
its association with the new town. The <cite>Herald</cite>, like its editor,
was Republican and countless issues consisted of rundowns of the local
party ticket and platform. Morford was a prototypical frontier editor:
ardently boosting for the home town and frequently picking fights with the
other local editors. Singing the praises of the "most fertile and
productive [area] in the territory," he chided local community leaders:
"The town is here to stay and the more beautiful and attractive we can
make it, the more will it be chosen as a place of residence and therefore
the more will its business be increased."<a href="#18" class="footnote">18</a>
<cite>The Arizona Republican</cite> purchased the <cite>Herald</cite> in
May 1899 for its Associated Press franchise and ceased publication in
September 1900.<a href="#19" class="footnote">19</a>
</p>
<p>
Morford's partisan periodical soon attracted competition from the other
side of the fence. The Democratic <cite>Arizona Gazette</cite> started
daily circulation in October 1880 under the editorship of Charles H.
McNeil. Billing itself as "the newsiest paper," the <cite>Gazette</cite>
lapsed into boosterism even more so than the <cite>Herald</cite>. It
hailed the coming of the Arizona Canal: "It will furnish water to reclaim
lands which have been an unproductive desert of no value for any purpose.
It will be of incalculable benefit to this valley and the whole territory."<a href="#20" class="footnote">20</a>
</p>
<p>
In contrast to these two newspapers, <cite>The Arizona Republican</cite>
seemed positively objective. Its beautifully set type and copious wire
stories set it apart from its two daily competitors when it appeared on
the scene in 1890. Its longtime editor, J.W. Spear, put it best when he
said that "The Arizona Republican came into being in response to no
demand."<a href="#21" class="footnote">21</a> Spear, as one would expect,
was being generous for <cite>The Republican</cite> was founded by the then
territorial governor Lewis Wolfley and his Attorney General Clark
Churchill when negative coverage in the <cite>Herald</cite> got to be too
much for him. Wolfley hired two experienced, competent editors named
Charles Ziegenfuss and Edwin Gill who promptly struck a conciliatory tone
with the competition: "As we start, so will we continue, ever maintaining
honest rates, hiring honest Union labor, hoping to see our competitors
prosper and wax fat and to live in perennial peace. We come to build up,
not to put down."<a href="#22" class="footnote">22</a> Future owners,
editors, and business managers set the paper's finances on a sure footing,
purchased more elaborate presses, and hired more reporters. <cite>The
Republican</cite> bought the <cite>Herald</cite> in 1899 and the
<cite>Gazette</cite> in 1930.
</p>
<p>
On the Indian side, there were the Pimas and Maricopas. The Pima are a
northern branch of the Papago Indians (Tohono O'odham) of southern Arizona
and northern Mexico, and the Maricopa are of Yuman ancestry.<a href="#23" class="footnote">23</a>
The two tribes were actually split into two different reservations
established by Congressional edict in 1859: the Salt River and Gila River
Reservations. Each tribe had members in both reservations and the two
tribes intermingled peacefully and freely. They had only one enemy, the
Apaches, which they shared in common with the American population. The
reservations were situated in very fertile parts of the Salt River Valley
and, consequently, the tribes were successful farmers. Interestingly, the
original survey set aside 64,000 acres for the tribes, but seven
subsequent Executive Orders expanded its size up to 371,422 acres.<a href="#24" class="footnote">24</a>
The reservations bordered the entire southern half of the Valley and the
far eastern portion of the American settlements. The populations of the
two tribes remained stable during this period at between 3,500 and 4,500
Pima and 300-500 Maricopa.<a href="#25" class="footnote">25</a>
</p>
<p>
The Pima, by all accounts, had existed in the Salt River Valley forever
and there are no stories of the tribe's creation. The Maricopas, on the
other hand, were relatively recent migrants&mdash;being in the Gila and
Salt River area for only about two centuries. According to the Maricopa
chief Juan Chevaria, the Maricopa had a quarrel with the other Yumans and
moved up the Gila River from the Colorado River to join the Pimas.<a href="#26" class="footnote">26</a>
Father Eusebio Kino, famous for his expeditions into Arizona in the late
seventeenth centuries to convert the Indians, described the two tribes as
"affable and docile people" who treated his party with "almost the same
courtesy as if we had journeyed among Christians."<a href="#27" class="footnote">27</a>
</p>
<p>
After generations of intermarriage and mingling, the two tribes had become
a strong confederation. Sharing a common enemy in the Apaches and a common
purpose in agriculture, they formed a union that benefitted all. They
still had different languages, customs, dress, and cultures but the harsh
desert environs and constant threat of Apache raids cemented the tribal
partnership such that later visitors spoke of them as "the Pimas and
Maricopas"&mdash;nearly a singular unit. The Pimas, however, always had
the upper hand since their population was consistently ten times larger
than the Maricopas.<a href="#28" class="footnote">28</a>
</p>
<p>
The tribes' first encounters with Americans<a href="#29" class="footnote">29</a>
occurred in 1827 with the expedition of a Dr. Anderson, who noted
"particularly hospitable treatment at the hands of the Pimas and of the
Maricopas." The Gila River Valley was crisscrossed many more times in the
antebellum period and the tribes met many famous Americans including Kit
Carson, John C. Fr&eacute;mont, Pauline Weaver, and General Kearney.<a href="#30" class="footnote">30</a>
All travelers were impressed with the Pima/Maricopa civilization,
agricultural efforts, and hospitality. Colonel Philip St. George Cooke,
commander of the Mormon Battalion during the Mexican War, was amazed by
the Pimas and Maricopas:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I halted one day near the villages of this friendly, guileless, and
singularly innocent and cheerful people, the Pimos. I traded the Indian
goods and every spare article for corn. After feeding it several days, I
brought away twelve quarts for each public animal.
</p>
<p>
The Pimos and Maricopas &hellip; wonderfully honest and friendly to
strangers, raise corn and wheat, which they grind and sell cheaply for
bleached domestics, summer clothing of all sorts, showy cotton
handkerchiefs, and white beads.<a href="#31" class="footnote">31</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Pima-Maricopas protected the incipient American settlements at a time
when the Apaches were most predatory and before the U.S. Army presence in
the West had become established. One correspondent noted in 1858 that
"since the year 1849, they have acted in the capacity of, and with even
more efficiency than, a frontier military. They have protected American
emigrants from molestation by the Apaches, and when the latter have stolen
stock from the emigrants, the Pimas and Maricopas have punished them and
recovered their animals."<a href="#32" class="footnote">32</a>
</p>
<p>
The thing that most impressed all American visitors was the agricultural
success of the two tribes. U.S. deputy surveyor H.S. Washburn noted that
"they raise corn, pumpkins, beans, and melons in great abundance; also
cotton, from which they weave cloth and make their own clothing."<a href="#33" class="footnote">33</a>
Samuel Cozzens, a traveler through the area, was surprised by their
output:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Nearly the whole of the land thus set apart has been cultivated by these
Indians for more than three hundred years, and still without dressing of
any kind yields full thirtyfold crops. Colonel Grey, whom we met here, and
who had surveyed the reservation, assured us that they had at least four
hundred miles of acequias [canals] already constructed upon the
reservation, and for many years had raised fine crops of wheat, corn,
tobacco, and cotton.
</p>
<p>
They have nearly a thousand separate enclosures, which are divided by
very excellent fences, made of crooked sticks and mesquit. [sic] During
the year of our visit [1859] they had sold the mail company more than
four hundred thousand pounds of wheat, besides large quantities of
corn, beans, pumpkins, and melons.<a href="#34" class="footnote">34</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This agricultural output proved to be a boon for the United States during
the Civil War. The minor skirmish at Picacho Peak between Union and
Confederate troops only hinted at the wartime activities within the
territory. Tucson fell to the Confederacy without resistance and Apaches
were enlisted to harass the Union soldiers bringing California goods to
the East. The Pima and Maricopas were instrumental in supplying the
Union's California Column with provisions and even provided two companies
of volunteers to aid the U.S. government in suppressing the Apaches.<a href="#35" class="footnote">35</a>
Colonel James Carleton was able to secure 143,000 pounds of wheat
immediately with an order of 400,000 pounds at harvest, which allowed him
to carry out operations within the territory.<a href="#36" class="footnote">36</a>
Further accounts of their agricultural production put output at 2,000,000
pounds of wheat and corn in 1867 and another 2,000,000 pounds in 1876.<a href="#37" class="footnote">37</a>
Enoch Conklin, a traveler visiting the area's mines, summed up the tribes'
abilities when he said, "Nor can the people nor the Government in its
Indian policy claim any credit for this condition of these Indians. These
facts speak well for both the Indians and for Arizona lands."<a href="#38" class="footnote">38</a>
</p>
<p>
From the 1870s to statehood in 1912, this pattern of amazing production
and self-sufficiency deteriorated into utter subsistence and dependency.
By 1900, the superintendent of the Phoenix Indian School could say that
"they have gradually fallen from a condition of independence and
prosperity until they are practically on the verge of starvation, and are
largely dependent upon Government rations for support."<a href="#39" class="footnote">39</a>
The cause of the Indian slide was a scarcity of water&mdash;the ditches
Father Kino marveled at during his expeditions&mdash;were practically dry
because the Gila River was at low levels or dry during the planting
season. The Indians quickly fixed the blame for their degradation at the
hands of the American farmers whose extensive reuse of Hohokam canals and
creation of mammoth canals like the vaunted Arizona Canal in 1885 had
enabled the incredible agricultural production already noted.
</p>
<p>
There is definitely some basis for such a conclusion. With nearly 130,000
acres under cultivation in Maricopa County alone in 1896, the water supply
provided by the Salt and Gila Rivers was decidedly strained. A proposed
lawsuit in federal court to secure the Indians' prior right of water
appropriation alleged:
</p>
<blockquote>
There are 960 persons using water from the Gila River above the point
where the Pima Indians divert the water of the Gila for their lands; that
there is no doubt but that the case could be taken up and prosecuted to a
favorable ending, but the interests are so varied, and the water diverted
by the whites as far as 200 miles above the Indian's point of diversion,
that should a favorable decree be given by the court it would be
impossible for the court to enforce its decree, and that the expense of
prosecuting such suit would cost between twenty and thirty thousand
dollars; but that a suit against the users of water under the Florence
Canal may be won and the court's decree made binding on the few persons
under the Florence Canal, and the expense to the Government would be about
$10,000.<a href="#40" class="footnote">40</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Unfortunately, the lawsuit never came to fruition. A successful judgement,
though, probably would not have alleviated the Indians' suffering since
the American farmers up the river were experiencing a similar drought. To
be sure, the newer farmers&mdash;being greater in number&mdash;were
diminishing the water supply but the problem was larger than that and
could only be solved by construction of reservoirs and dams to regulate
and control the available water. Senator Carl Hayden, elected at statehood
in 1912, led a Congressional investigation on the Pima's water troubles in
1924 and determined that the problem was primarily one of erosion, which
led to silt buildup in the river beds and eventually the drying up of the
river systems.<a href="#41" class="footnote">41</a> The Pima ended the
period under consideration destitute and wards of the state, a pitiful
position after an extended period of prosperity.
</p>
<p>
This downslide brought the Pima into greater contact with the American
residents of the Valley. Driven from their traditional farming methods,
they emigrated to the Salt River Reservation to farm or sought employment
in the Phoenix area to provide for their families. At least, that's the
positive scenarios for how they could feed their kin. Often, they took to
stealing food from the American farmers and townspeople. This led to minor
hostilities and a handful of murders, but nothing particularly serious or
epidemic.<a href="#42" class="footnote">42</a> There was some resentment
towards the increased Indian presence in Phoenix, resulting in some city
regulations in 1881 and 1889 banning Indians from the town after sundown
unless employed by whites.<a href="#43" class="footnote">43</a> In
general, though, the tensions were minimal and the two sides never
harbored any serious ill-will towards each other.
</p>
<p>
The Indian presence in Phoenix was increased in 1891-2 by the creation of
the Phoenix Indian School, established with federal funds to educate
Indian children from around Arizona. The location of the school,
originally slated to go in the abandoned Fort McDowell, was finally sealed
in 1891 with the sale of Frank Hatch's 160-acre ranch to Phoenix for use
by the federal government. The school officially opened on September 13,
1891 with a class of forty-one Pimas and Maricopas. By the turn of the
century, it housed over seven hundred Indian children from more than a
dozen tribes and offered Phoenix a very successful "outing" program,
whereby students could work for local businesses and families. The school
also contributed to the community's prosperity by its annual budget of
$130,000 and its students' purchase of goods and services.<a href="#44" class="footnote">44</a>
</p>
<p>
The newspapers' coverage of Indians can be categorized into three
divisions: negative, neutral, and positive. Since these terms are
inherently relative, it would do well to explain what value position
serves as the fountainhead for these judgements. The "negative"
categorization encompasses a number of possible situations: calls for
genocide, denouncement of sympathy to Indians, holding of Indians to a
different standard than Americans, and general stereotyping. A "neutral"
designation generally stems from a mostly factual or repertorial article
about Indian policy or straightforward vignettes about Indians in the
community without negative connotations. Finally, the "positive" label is
used for articles that encourage the civilization of the Indian, promote
the establishment of the Phoenix Indian School, express sympathy for
Indian suffering, and applaud the Pima and Maricopa tribes. These
demarcations are muddied by the fact that many articles crossed over into
several categories; in those instances, the predominant sentiment was
determined and the article was filed within that category. Derogatory
statements about "savages" and "red devils" were not automatic grounds for
a "negative" label since language was generally gruff and such language
often enshrouded a genuine concern for Indian welfare. Where an article
was equivocal, such derogations would move the article into the "negative"
tabulation. We will now examine each category of article in turn.
</p>
<p>
Negative articles are predictably prevalent and generally fall into
distinct patterns like the Apache menace, Sioux war coverage, Eastern
sentimentalism, and Indian stereotypes. These too are not perfectly
separated, for an article decrying Eastern sentimentalism would naturally
include references to the Apache menace and involve Indian stereotypes.
Again, for the purposes of classification, articles of mixed nature belong
to the dominant type.
</p>
<p>
By far the most common of the negative press coverage was devoted to the
Apaches and their marauding of the American settlers in northern, eastern,
and southern Arizona. The recounting of the murdering of Americans by
Apaches filled many a column-inch.<a href="#45" class="footnote">45</a>
For example, the murder of tourist John Hardie in 1890, who became a
martyr of the Apache haters that occupied the territorial press, by a band
of San Carlos Reservation Apaches on the loose was a popular motif: "The
murder of Hardie should open the eyes of Eastern people to the nature of
the Apache. It makes no difference to them who their victims are, whether
friend or foe, soldier or civilian. They kill merely for plunder and the
fun of seeing the unfortunates fall."<a href="#46" class="footnote">46</a>
The delay shown by the U.S. Army at Fort Bowie was decried and the paper
charged that "failure to [recapture the Apaches] will make the army
accessory to any crimes which they may commit."<a href="#47" class="footnote">47</a>
</p>
<p>
A story about the murder of a family of four in the Rincon Mountains
hinted at Apache guilt without substantiation in a telling portrayal of
how quickly any distant murder was blamed on the Apaches.<a href="#48" class="footnote">48</a>
That particular murder led <cite>The Arizona Republican</cite> to call for
"prompt action" and "demand that the soldiers in the Territory get to work
and annihilate these red cutthroats."<a href="#49">49</a>  Sometimes those
assailed by Apaches took the matter into their own hands and were
applauded for their efforts by the papers and the community at large: "On
Memorial Day [several prominent Prescott residents] spread flowers on the
grave &hellip; of the gallant Townsend, who had, single handed, fought and
whipped whole bands of Apaches, killing twenty-six of them in less than
two years."<a href="#50" class="footnote">50</a>
</p>
<p>
Many of the anti-Apache articles were vicious in their suggestions about
how to resolve the Apache problem. <cite>The Arizona Republican</cite>
suggested that Arizona citizens "repeat the work of the white settlers in
Inyo county, California" and "rise in their might and wipe every Apache
off the face of the earth &hellip; the sooner such action is taken the
better, too."<a href="#51" class="footnote">51</a>
</p>
<p>
In general, though, the newspapers hesitated to call for vigilantism,
instead relying on the military for protection and retribution. <cite>The
Arizona Republican</cite>, for example, stated that it "earnestly hopes
that the Washington authorities will grant [General Nelson Miles] full and
immediate power to proceed in the manner he has outlined." The manner
suggested would "forever relieve this Territory of further depredations by
this murderous band" and required a "complete breaking up of the tribe and
their removal to some station away from their present mountain retreats."<a href="#52" class="footnote">52</a>
Other solutions proposed by the newspapers were the formation of ranger
units under the command of the Territorial Governor with the mission of
running down any Apaches leaving the San Carlos Reservation and comprised
"only of men directly interested in the capture or death of the Apache
marauders."<a href="#53" class="footnote">53</a> Another recommendation
was the removal of alcohol and ammunition from the possession of the
Apaches at San Carlos. Said Deputy United States Marshal Frank Porter,
"When the Arizona Indians are wholly deprived of tiswin [an Indian wine],
cartridges and whiskey, and are so situated as to make it an impossibility
to get them, the while trouble with the Apaches and every kind of an
Indian is at an end."<a href="#54" class="footnote">54</a>
</p>
<p>
Whatever the solution under consideration, the press was a "unit on the
question of wanting Indians removed from the Territory."<a href="#55" class="footnote">55</a>
They knew that the Apaches were not welcome in the midst of the American
settlers, as evidenced by the vehemence with which they denounced General
Miles' plan to relocate some San Carlos Apaches to the abandoned military
encampment at Fort Verde.<a href="#56" class="footnote">56</a> When parts
of Geronimo's band were returned to New Mexico from Alabama for health
reasons, <cite>The Republican</cite> noted that "while Apache residence in
the Southern States is not very salubrious for the Indians, it is a
remarkably healthful proposition as far as it concerns the cattlemen and
prospectors of Southeastern Arizona."<a href="#57" class="footnote">57</a>
</p>
<p>
Another group that frequently earned the opprobrium of the local
newspapers was the Sioux. Even though the fighting was quite remote from
the Salt River Valley, the plight of settlers facing Indian depredations
was a common concern among frontier residents. A number of articles in
<cite>The Arizona Republican</cite> discussed the situation leading up to
the Wounded Knee massacre. One story recounted the treachery of a band of
surrendering Sioux, who retrieved their weaponry from a secreted cache and
inflicted considerable casualties on the surprised army. It described the
incident as "so natural to the Indian character that no frontiersman is
surprised." It went on to suggest that the soldiers, after repulsing the
Indian attack, then "hunted down and destroyed its perpetrators." Finally,
the article described the nature of the Sioux:
</p>
<blockquote>
The fact is not appreciated that the extermination of this band of
biped wolves would have more influence in restraining their fellows
from the exercise of their native ferocity than a thousand sermons. The
Sioux does not appreciate kindness; an attempt at conciliation means to
him a manifestation of fear. Force and stern measures alone will win
his respect, for exactly the same reason that the iron bar is necessary
to control the caged tiger. In cunning and cruelty lie his chief
delights. It is about time that these facts were appreciated and that
the welfare of the great West was considered independently of the
"claims of the poor Indian."<a href="#58" class="footnote">58</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
An earlier article enumerated the rumored plans of the Sioux, which
included enticing a company of men into a mountain ravine for slaughtering
or assassinating General Brooke under the guise of a peace delegation. The
motivation ascribed to these guerilla tactics was "long-suppressed native
ferocity, that desires only the slightest pretext for a spring at a
victim."<a href="#59" class="footnote">59</a> Finally, two other articles
suggest that General Miles' ultimatum had "the right ring to it" to bring
"some good Indian news from the northwest within the next forty-eight
hours" and that the Sioux uprising&mdash;with its Ghost Dance and promise
of a Messiah&mdash;was a carefully planned conspiracy by the Mormons.<a href="#60" class="footnote">60</a>
</p>
<p>
The dominant theme of the negative Indian coverage related only
peripherally to the Indians. The do-gooder back East who chided Westerners
about the condition of the Indians and remonstrated them for atrocities
committed against the Indians disgusted the Western newspapermen. One
editorial entitled "Outrageous Sentimentalism" excoriated the Indian
Rights Association for what the writer termed its "insane love for the
vicious." The subject of the editorial is the suspension of Colonel
Forsythe for the killing of women and children at Wounded Knee. The writer
opines, "It seems incredible to a western man that an influential class in
the East will obstinately close their eyes to the fact that the Indian is
not a human in the ordinary acceptance of the term; the he is but a wolf
in instinct, though a biped in form."<a href="#61" class="footnote">61</a>
</p>
<p>
An earlier editorial branded members of the Indian Rights Association as
"Enemies of the Whites." The article inveighed against those who "view
every outburst of deviltry as simply a roughly expressed protest against
wrongs and demand that in the event of capture 'Poor Lo' shall be treated,
not as a felon but as a prisoner of war." The writer concludes, "Words of
sufficient force are not in the lexicon to express the feelings of the
frontiersman who remembers the deeds of this hoary devil of the plains
[Sitting Bull], whose only delight and employment has ever been to wield
death and destruction, and whom mawkish sentiment alone had saved from the
hangman years ago."<a href="#62" class="footnote">62</a>
</p>
<p>
Another editorial suggested that an Indian uprising in the northwest might
be a good thing because it might "result in the overthrow of the sickly
pro-Indian sentiment in the East." It asserts that members of the Indian
Rights Association are unfamiliar with Indians and have a romantic notion
of the Indian obtained through the works of James Fenimore Cooper. It
further recommends that these philanthropists "investigate and appreciate
the reason for the bitter feeling that exists upon the frontier against
those tribes." The editorial writer then lays out a course of action that
captures the essence of the theory:
</p>
<blockquote>
Nothing but force will restrain them, nothing but fear will induce them to
refrain from murder and rapine. Every Indian who is captured after a
murderous raid should be hanged. He is not a prisoner of war. He is simply
a criminal, a vile murderer, and as such he should be amenable to the
civil law. Had such a course been adopted with Sitting Bull's band, the
present rumored outbreak would never have been heard of. If such a course
had been adopted with the first band of Apache marauders who ever went
upon the warpath, the Apaches today would be as peaceable as the Pimas.
Enforce upon them the law, which, though severe, is just and productive of
good to the greatest number.<a href="#63" class="footnote">63</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
The influence of the sympathizers of Indians made the course of action
desired by this writer unfeasible. That obstruction of swift action made
many a frontier settler livid.<a href="#64" class="footnote">64</a>
</p>
<p>
The last sort of negative article conveyed stereotypical views of the
Indians or enforced a double-standard against the Indians. Sadly, these
too were common. Most of them focused on the Indians' consumption of
alcohol. Accounts were generally brief&mdash;'Last night Watchman Roundy
arrested two drunken Indians who were attempting to steal from the
premises of the Tiger saloon. Efforts should be made to ascertain where
the Indians obtain their liquor, as a drunken Redman is no uncommon sight
on our streets."&mdash;and included the ubiquitous call to roust out the
sellers.<a href="#65" class="footnote">65</a> The elimination of the sale
of "liquid perdition" to the Indians was almost always sought in order to
protect the balance of the two races: "It is a matter that deserves a
careful consideration by our people, as sooner or later, if the sale of
intoxicating liquors to Indians is not stopped, trouble between the two
races will ensue, and such an event at the present time would give Arizona
such a setback that it would take it years to recover."<a href="#66" class="footnote">66</a>
While there are innumerable articles assailing the sale of alcohol to
Indians because of the deviant behavior it encourages, nothing of the sort
was proposed for the American settlers who were surely just as
destructively influenced by the drink.
</p>
<p>
Other stereotypes confirmed by the newspapers of the region were the
Indian as a horse thief<a href="#67" class="footnote">67</a>, the Indian
as a covetous murderer<a href="#68" class="footnote">68</a>, the Indian as
a despoiler of men<a href="#69" class="footnote">69</a>, and the Indian as
a foolhardy show-off.<a href="#70" class="footnote">70</a> All of these
were presented with little editorial comment since the stereotype
presented itself spoke volumes to the reader. What's more, the notion of
"reportorial objectivity convinces readers and journalists alike that the
media product somehow represents Indian 'reality'."<a href="#71" class="footnote">71</a>
In other words, the printed word takes on an objectivity that it may not
deserve.
</p>
<p>
The "neutral" articles, in contrast to the "negative" and "positive"
stories, were relatively few in number. They were more or less simple
statements of fact and were of interest for the history they convey. For
example, an article in the April 12, 1891 issue of <cite>The Arizona
Republican</cite> describes the preparations for the Phoenix Indian
School, including the expenditure for the purchase of Frank Hatch's ranch
and the securing of an architect for its construction. Another details the
coming year's Indian appropriation of $6,000,000 and shows the breakdown
of the funds into agricultural training and school construction.<a href="#72" class="footnote">72</a>
Two other articles relate the archaeological discovery of ancient ruins
and call for their preservation.<a href="#73" class="footnote">73</a> The
final type of "neutral" article offers short vignettes of Indians that
lack any demonstrable stereotyping. These might be as simple as a brief
tribute to "Old Betsy," a Sioux living in Prescott that was said to be
over one hundred years old, to an anecdote about the business difficulties
of a Pima named "Bismarck" or a humorous story about a female Papago in
Tombstone negotiating the town's dress code.<a href="#74" class="footnote">74</a>
</p>
<p>
The "positive" articles, as mentioned earlier, promote the civilization of
the Indians, laud the Phoenix Indian School, express sympathy for Indian
suffering, and focus on the Pima and Maricopa tribes. It is not
fashionable to suggest that the first two patterns are positive or
praiseworthy, but the fact remains that they were motivated by concern for
the betterment of the Indian. While modern scholars stridently blast the
nineteenth century as a time of colonization, that evaluation presupposes
an entirely different context than existed contemporaneously and
represents an anachronistic view of history. The individuals and
governments of that time encountered the Indian as a foe to be
vanquished in order to settle territory&mdash;much like Americans viewed
the Mexicans and Spanish during the first half of the nineteenth century.
The diligent student of history would do well to imagine himself in the
context of his subject in order to further understanding.
</p>
<p>
Seemingly everyone with any interest in the question had an opinion about
how best to effect the civilization of the Indians. General Crook, the
famous military commander, believed that "the condition of the Indians,
morally and industrially, would be greatly improved by conferring upon
them the franchise" with the requirement that its exercise be restricted
to the literate. The right to vote would be conferred upon his adoption as
a citizen, which would be preceded by an end of tribal relations, a
provision of farming equipment, and an education.<a href="#75" class="footnote">75</a>
The Indian Agent of the Sacaton Agency, Roswell G. Wheeler, proposed to
settle the Pima and Papago Indians in adobe houses instead of their
traditional wickieups. In order to obtain their cooperation, he gave each
head of household a new wagon with which to carry firewood and supplies.
With this, he obtained written promises that the Indians would agree "to
wear clothing, to use no paint on their faces, to wear short hair and to
drink no whisky."<a href="#76" class="footnote">76</a> Later news reports
indicated that these heads of household built the adobe houses to complete
the requirements and then continued to live in their traditional
dwellings.<a href="#77" class="footnote">77</a>
</p>
<p>
Many offered a much harsher means of solving the Indian question. The
suggestion fit well with the social philosophy then in vogue: Social
Darwinism: "Let our Government at once recognize the Indian as no better
than a white man, and entitled to no more privileges. Let him be placed on
public land, and agricultural implements given him, and then if he is not
able to support himself, let him starve. If he does murder, let him be
punished for murder, and for every offence he may commit, let a swift and
just retribution follow."<a href="#78" class="footnote">78</a>
Superintendent of Public Instruction George Cheyney echoed these
sentiments and was applauded by <cite>The Arizona Republican</cite>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The power to punish and the will to submit is the source of control,
and the well-being and maintenance of society. Anything else is
anarchy. That the offender shall be punished for his offenses is both
Divine and human law and is the first lesson to be learned in the
evolution of civilization from barbarism.
</p>
<p>
It is the first lesson we teach our children at school, and it is the
first lesson you must teach the Indian.
</p>
<p>
When he offends punish him <em>as you would a white man for the same
offense</em> and you have solved the most serious part of your problem,
you will have deserved and compelled his respect, and you will have
commenced your pyramid of education at the base, and not as you are
now doing, at the apex.<a href="#79" class="footnote">79</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Cheyney's letter was a response to the letter of T.J. Morgan, Commissioner
of Indian Affairs. Morgan had opined that "the whites of such localities
are as much interested in this plan of educating the Indian children as
the Indians are themselves, not only because of the money received, but
especially because the Indians thus brought into the public schools and
into pleasant relations with white children will more readily become
fitted for good citizenship."<a href="#80" class="footnote">80</a>
Morgan's subsequent reply to Cheyney cited examples of successes arising
from the Indian schools and pleaded with Cheyney to reconsider the
integration of Indian children in the public schools.<a href="#81" class="footnote">81</a>
</p>
<p>
Education figured everywhere in the plans for civilizing the Indians. The
Phoenix Indian School was naturally featured most prominently in the
press, but other schools were heralded for their efforts at educating the
Indians. <cite>The Arizona Republican</cite> highlighted the Yuma school,
describing in considerable detail its program of home economics and
carpentry in addition to its traditional subjects. Sister Ambrosia,
headmistress of the school, observed, "The influence of the school is good
upon all the tribe too, as well as upon those who come here. When the boys
and girls go home, dressed in civilized garb and looking neat and clean,
the others realize the superiority of education and want to be like
them."<a href="#82" class="footnote">82</a> The Fort Mohave Indian school
superintendent  McCowan explained to a large group of Wallapai Indians
that it was to their advantage to be able to "make their own clothes,
guns, plows and wagons, and have their children able to write letters,
read the papers, etc."<a href="#83" class="footnote">83</a>
</p>
<p>
Of course, the establishment of Indian schools served community interests
as well. Articles expounded on the financial advantages of the Phoenix
Indian School, which was expected to bring considerable business to the
Valley in the form of construction, supplies, and other
expenditures.<a href="#84" class="footnote">84</a> The "outing system"
previously mentioned was also seen as a welcome opportunity: "During the
busy time of summer, when for lack of pickers the grapes and peaches are
growing overripe, it will be well to remember that the Pimas are excellent
at such employment and that the Indian school will have a number of handy
lads available."<a href="#85" class="footnote">85</a>
</p>
<p>
In times of trouble, the newspapers evinced a genuine sympathy for the
Indians. During the flooding of February 1891, nearly the entire area
surrounding the Salt and Gila Rivers was washed out. This affected
everyone in the Valley, but the Indians were particularly hard hit because
the floodwaters destroyed their canals, crops, homes, and
granaries.<a href="#86" class="footnote">86</a> <cite>The Arizona
Republican</cite> also called on the government to repair their ditches
and to construct new ones to feed fields further from the river's banks.
Noting that fully ninety percent of their fields were decimated, the
article further recommends preparation for their relief by the summer to
prevent famine.<a href="#87" class="footnote">87</a> Quick calls for
support during times of want were also provided for the Wallapai, who were
deemed "peaceable" and "well disposed towards the whites." The article
also showed sympathy for their condition since they were a mountain people
brought down to the reservation on the Colorado River
bottom.<a href="#88" class="footnote">88</a>
</p>
<p>
The most glowing positive press coverage was devoted to the Pima and
Maricopa tribes. These two tribes inspired admiration among the American
residents because of their agricultural prowess and participation in the
local economy. For example, an article in <cite>The Arizona
Republican</cite> exclaimed that "Pima Indians Beat the World's Record for
New Wheat" and noted that, even with crude and ancient farming methods,
they were still able to produce a considerable
surplus.<a href="#89" class="footnote">89</a> Another issue's "Sketch of
the Pimas and Maricopas" article described them as "fine specimens of the
American Indian" and lauded the "excellent quality" of their wheat. The
article also acknowledges their peaceable nature and ability to
learn.<a href="#90" class="footnote">90</a> Other articles commended the
tribes for their roles in subduing and conquering the much-hated
Apaches.<a href="#91" class="footnote">91</a>
</p>
<p>
The previous articles show that the perceptions of the Indians in the
Phoenix press were more nuanced than one might think. Further research
into more newspapers over the entire period would further illuminate these
perceptions. It is entirely possible that the articles consulted in the
years considered were aberrations and unrepresentative of Valley
sentiments. In addition to a deeper study of the newspapers, a more
comprehensive investigation would require examination of contemporaneous
correspondence and personal journals. This would show whether or not the
newspapers' perspectives were representative of the population's views and
how much influence newspapers had. Furthermore, a consultation of the
secondary literature could indicate how representative both Phoenix and
her newspapers' situation were in the larger American picture. Finally, a
historiographic review of Indians in the newspaper would place the work in
a larger historical canon. This essay represents a first step in this much
larger project.
</p>
<p>
Although there is still much work to be done in this area, the importance
of the topic is unquestionable. The newspapers of Phoenix played a vital
role in building the community and tying it into the larger American
context. Arguing for the development and settlement of the Salt River
Valley, the newspapers simultaneously recognized and respected the
indigenous population already there. Propagation of that recognition and
respect calmed relations between the Indians and the Americans such that
no organized group violence ever took place between the two groups of
Phoenicians. Such a lack of violence between the two makes for a unique
example since most frontier settlements near tribes experienced conflict.
</p>
<p>
This is not to say that territorial-era Phoenix represented a shining
example of progressive tolerance and understanding of the Indian. Far from
it, for the newspapers evinced a stunning ignorance about and prejudice of
non-Salt-River-Valley Indians. Their disdain and vitriol concerning the
Indians' benefactors in the East was particularly intolerant. Although
Phoenix's relationship with the Pimas and Maricopas was atypical, its
opinion of the Apaches and the Sioux was quintessentially Western.
Attacking them as bloodthirsty savages, they conveniently ignored the
underlying cause of the Apache's violent behavior. Rather than
understanding the actions as a natural outgrowth of a people at war, the
newspapers chose instead to focus on the behavior as indicative of
baseness&mdash;some inherent evil within. The treatment of the Pimas and
Maricopas demonstrates that the newspapers, when devoid of knee-jerk
reactions to wartime atrocity, could sympathize and understand the
Indians' culture. And that sensitivity indicates that the popular image of
a frontier civilization hell-bent on eradication of the Indians is
two-dimensional.

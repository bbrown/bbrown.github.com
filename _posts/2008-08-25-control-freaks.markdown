"When we hear about rent control or gun control, we may think about rent or guns but the word that really matters is 'control.' That is what the political left is all about, as you can see by the incessant creation of new restrictions in places where they are strongly entrenched in power, such as San Francisco or New York." &#x2014; Thomas Sowell, <a href="http://www.CapMag.com/article.asp?ID=5249">"Random Thoughts"</a>

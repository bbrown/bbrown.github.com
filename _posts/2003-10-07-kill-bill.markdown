<br /><a href="http://www.filmstew.com/Content/ReviewsViews/Details.asp?ContentID=6947"><cite>Kill Bill</cite></a> sounds like an interesting movie. I've never seen a Quentin Tarantino film (I avoided <cite>Pulp Fiction</cite> like the plague) and the hype-o-meter is off the charts on this one, but the premise is bizarre enough that it might be worth seeing. That and <a href="http://www.bubbahotep.com/"><cite>Bubba Ho-Tep</cite></a>.<br /><br /><br />

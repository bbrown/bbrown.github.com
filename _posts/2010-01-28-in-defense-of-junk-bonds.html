MCI, Disney, News Corporation, RJR Nabisco, Revlon, Wynn Enterprises,
Mattel, Viacom, TCI Cable, Time Warner, Barnes &amp; Noble, CNN. Each of
these corporations owes its existence and rise to greatness to one
innovation. In fact, this one innovation completely turned around the
American economy, spurring the second-largest, sustained growth in the
twentieth century. More impressively still, this innovation was the
product of one man. The innovation? High-yield bonds&mdash;or junk bonds,
in common parlance. The man? Michael Milken.
</p>
<p>
High-yield bonds have been around since bonds had come about. A high-yield
bond is simply a debt instrument that must carry a higher rate in order to
attract buyers, usually because the issuing company has fallen on hard
times. At least, that is the presumption behind the subpar ratings given
the bonds by standard rating agencies like Moody's or Standard &amp;
Poor's. Michael Milken, while still in college, had chanced upon a
comprehensive study by Braddock Hickman of the corporate bond market from
1900 to 1943. After careful perusal, Milken realized that most of the
downgraded bonds studied had actually been safer and more profitable than
the so-called triple A-rated bonds.
</p>
<p>
And that is where Milken found his niche. His task was to persuade
investors that junk  bonds were a profitable, safe investment. The
obstacle he had to overcome was the ratings agencies. A lower than triple
A mark sent the institutional investors&mdash;such as pension funds,
insurance companies, and banks&mdash;running. Through voluminous knowledge
and research, he was able to convince bond buyers that junk bonds were
really underdogs depressed by complacent bond rating companies and not the
dregs of the American economy.
</p>
<p>
In the beginning, Milken sought to create a market for these junk
bonds&mdash;breathing liquidity into an otherwise staid instrument; he was
at the nexus of buyers and sellers of non-investment grade debt. Cut off
from underwriting by a brokerage house and faced with intolerable interest
rates from banks or dilution of ownership through stock issues, the junk
bond was the only option available to a company that had encountered the
disdain of a bond rater. If investors knew they could find a seller when
their nerve wavered, the junk bond lost its unseemliness. Milken provided
them the assurance that, if no one else would buy it, either he or his
firm&mdash;Drexel Burnham Lambert&mdash;would. Given Milken's charisma and
Drexel's rising stature, this was no small guarantee.
</p>
<p>
After establishing a junk bond trading network, Milken moved on to more
lucrative and substantial feats. Rather than simply buying and selling
securities, he wanted to create them. That is, he wanted to move Drexel
from a third-tier Wall Street firm to the top of the industry. He sought
to finance the growing merger frenzy; he wanted to expand the economy by
funding its ablest corporations; he wanted to showcase the power of the
junk bond. He did this by finding upstart, well-managed companies and
providing them with more than enough financial capital to achieve their
wildest desires.
</p>
<p>
Often, their wildest desires included purchasing bloated, inefficient
conglomerates. The sixties and seventies have been characterized as
decades of consolidation. Huge corporations like ITT and Beatrice Foods
were created from a diverse spectrum of smaller companies. At the time,
this made sense because of the economies of scale in management. However,
by the eighties, these conglomerates had become inefficient and unwieldy.
The so-called "corporate raiders" financed by Milken's junk bonds served
an important function: shaking up complacent businesses either by takeover
or threat of takeover.
</p>
<p>
At the opposite end of the upstarts' dreams were the expansionist
companies. These corporations were spectacularly undercapitalized and in
desperate need of Milken's creative means of financing. They had great
ideas and enormous potential but were trapped by the establishment's fear
of change and risk. Milken had no such phobia and eagerly arranged for the
funding of their goals. For example, MCI was regularly laughed out of Wall
Street firms for its incredible dream of challenging AT&amp;T's dominance
in long-distance calling. Milken saw its potential and coordinated $1
billion initially and $3 billion eventually in order for MCI to construct
the fiber-optic network AT&amp;T had passed over. The current status of
MCI vis-&agrave;-vis AT&amp;T need not be mentioned. Similarly, when Ted
Turner envisioned a news channel with 24-hour-a-day coverage, he was
shunned. That is, until he came to Milken. Milken got Turner $100 million
in junk bonds which helped Turner to establish the informational
powerhouse that CNN is today.

<p>
Such innovation is central to the American economy and, more
fundamentally, the American way. Every facet, every aspect of our daily
lives has been profoundly impacted by the efforts of the "vital few,"
entrepreneurs whose vision and drive impelled them to produce. The
computer on which I am typing this essay was the product of Steven Jobs'
relentless pursuit of building the best computer. The light by which I
work was the result of Thomas Edison's boundless curiosity. I could not
have created such items. But in a capitalist society, I do not have to. I
need only create enough wealth through my own labor in order to compensate
them for their's. We each trade with the other to mutual benefit.
</p>
<p>
American history is littered with tales of the great industrialists of
yesteryear. Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, James J. Hill, J.P.
Morgan. The common bond between them is the innovative nature of their
minds. Carnegie organized capital and labor into the most efficient system
of production of steel. Rockefeller revolutionized the production and
delivery of oil. Hill created a financially responsible railroad without
government subsidization. Morgan created a new method of organizing and
financing businesses.
</p>
<p>
Michael Milken was the latest in a long chain of revolutionary innovators.

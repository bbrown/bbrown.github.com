<br />I have two dogs (a Dalmatian and a golden retriever/shar-pei mix) and two cats (an Oriental shorthair and a domestic tabby/Persian mix). We've had them anywhere from two years to ten years now and they're quite a part of our family. The dogs sleep on our bed&#x2014;the Dalmatian, having short fur, sleeps under the covers&#x2014;and the cats sleep on us when we're downstairs on our sofa. Each of them has a distinct personality that we've grown very accustomed to. It's weird, but they really feel like they're our "fur kids."<br /><br />But in reality, they're still animals and they occasionally do things to remind you that they're unpredictable. I was fooling around with Molly the Dalmatian and getting her quite riled up. Then I did the thing that I know really bugs her&#x2014;huffing around and blowing in her face&#x2014;when she growled a final time and chomped down hard on my left cheek. There's now some serious redness, which will probably become a nice bruise, and a gash right above my lip. I've got a picture, but it's not too good of one since <a href="/values/people/sandibrown.cfm">Sandi</a> wasn't really down with the whole photo opportunity it represented.<br /><br />I guess it's time to move on to the next phase of my life where I don't actively rough house with the dogs. If I had had one of my upcoming babies around, then I shudder to think what might have happened to an innocent bystander. I don't blame the dog because she is a wild animal. I knew better but I still pressed on. I made my bed, time to sleep. Just need to get out of that mode.<br /><br /><br />

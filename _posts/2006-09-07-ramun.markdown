<p>First off, any soda with instructions on how to open it (6 steps!!) is a point ahead in my book. Second, any soda whose cap is actually a marble held firmly in place by the carbonation of the soda itself is getting another point. Finally, I like oddly-shaped bottles of any sort. These things may be minor but they add to the experience and bespeak of an innovative spirit that most sodas demonstrably lack. But packaging will only get you so far in my book. It's got a Sprite-like taste and Sprite's one of my least favorite sodas. Add to that the fact that there's 6.76 ounces of soda and it's only getting 3 stars. I'd buy it again, but only because opening it was so much fun.

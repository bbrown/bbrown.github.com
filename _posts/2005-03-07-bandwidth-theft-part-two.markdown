<br />Geesh. Regular readers may remember <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/you-stole-my-bandwidth.cfm">last month's prank</a> on some punk kids stealing my bandwidth by using an image of my daughter. If you don't feel like reading that, I'll summarize: I replaced the picture they were expecting with a picture of a morbidly&#x2014;and that's being generous&#x2014;obese woman mooning the camera. I had a great laugh knowing that the image has been displayed several hundred times since then.<br /><br />Apparently, some other people at myspace.com enjoyed my prank and decided to use that picture in other people's comments. Of course, they couldn't be bothered to host the file themselves. Their mistake!<br /><br />It's time to up the ante, so they're getting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatse.cx">goatse</a>! If you don't know what that is, consider yourself lucky. It's a not-morbidly-obese gentleman doing what the lady was doing, except with a twist of anus spreading. I'm serious: don't click if you don't want to puke a little bit in your mouth. Of course, it's not safe for work.<br /><br />Here are the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&amp;friendID=6886254">offending</a> <a href="http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&amp;friendID=7288682">posts</a> decorated by yours truly. I warned you.<br /><br />P.S. Again, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&amp;friendID=4314574">Leandra</a>, I'm very sorry.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Oh, and to anticipate a question: I don't know where to go from here.]<br /><br /><br />

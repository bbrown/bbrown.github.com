<p>With <a href="http://www.fivebrowns.com/2006/10/more-pieces-to-fit-into-the-puzzle/">the recent events surrounding my daughter Madeline</a>, I got to thinking about the gaping hole in my genetic picture. My birth parents divorced when I was three years old and my mom remarried when I was 10. I never knew my birth father in any meaningful way. But I know that I've got his genetic material in me and I know that I've passed some of that along to my daughters. So it behooves me to consider him for medical history reasons alone.</p>
<p>My dad legally adopted me as his son in 1986 when I was twelve years old. My biological father met us at a Coco's near Paradise Valley Mall to sign the paperwork relinquishing his rights to be on my birth certificate and that sort of thing. That's the last time I've ever seen him and, oddly enough, I have no memory whatsoever of him from that encounter except his signature on the adoption papers. If that's not psychologically significant, I don't know what is.</p>
<p>So last night I spent a few hours doing some serious Googlefu and combing through public records. At about midnight, I finally found the final clue. My Maricopa County searching had resulted in a complete dead end after about 2004. I decided that Pima County (Tucson) and then Yavapai County (Prescott/Flagstaff) were the next best targets before I gave up and paid for one of those services on the Internet.</p>

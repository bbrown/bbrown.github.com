<br />Like the East Coast, I am without power for Thor, my PowerBook G4. Yet another power pack burnt out yesterday and so it's off to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/biltmore/">Apple Store</a> to beg and plead for a replacement after purchasing it earlier this year. That makes it my third power pack down the drain since I bought Thor in 2001. My first one actually was arcing and almost caught my carpet on fire&#x2014;well, it could have if I hadn't noticed the arcing.<br /><br />Apple makes great computers, but the power delivery systems suck wind.<br /><br /><br />

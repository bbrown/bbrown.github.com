<br /><a href="http://www.benorama.com/coldfusion/">ColdFusion Best Practices</a> from Benoit Hediard. This page covers some of his personal guidelines on using CFCs, custom tags, UDFs, and cfincludes. Site has some promise: he just needs to flesh out the <a href="http://www.benorama.com/flash/">Flash MX area</a>. I liked his <a href="http://www.benorama.com/mx/">explanation of rich Internet applications</a>.<br /><br /><br />

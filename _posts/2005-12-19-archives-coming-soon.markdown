<p>I tried importing my archives on Friday after we launched, but there was something wrong with the handling of line breaks. It's not a tough fix, so they'll be in there soon. It feels neat to be writing this entry in a tool I helped develop. Really, really neat.</p><p>[UPDATE (12/22/2005): Archives are back. The links are all different, but at least they're here.]

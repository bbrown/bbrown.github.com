<h2>The Single Most Important Battle in American History</h2>
<p>
The history of the United States of America has been plagued by clashes
between two warring factions. Both sides posit themselves as champions of
the people and the only salvation for America. They have fought many
battles, with each side scoring victories. I am talking of the skirmishes
between "republicanism" and liberalism. Liberalism is the system of
political philosophy best summarized by Thomas Jefferson's oft-quoted,
famous motto: "That government which governs best governs least." It is
the system of laissez-faire, trans."Let us alone!" It's cardinal values
are individual rights: life, liberty, and property. Everything in society
and government must be subordinated to these rights. People should be left
free to make their own decisions, their own choices without fear of
interference from the government or other people, so long as they respect
the rights of other people to do the same. When there exists a conflict
between an individual's right and society's interests (as defined by the
leadership of society), it is the individual who must prevail. Anything
less would leave individuals at the mercy of the mob. This conception of
the role of government stands in marked contrast to the notions of
community propounded by "republicanism." In this theory, there exists a
community that is independent and superior to the individuals that
comprise it. It has its own values that may or may not be those of the
individuals in the community. Further, if an individual, exercising a
right which liberalism might grant, comes against the rights of the
community, the "public good" must take precedence. The individual, it is
said, acquires responsibilities along with the rights that the community
grants him. This responsibility is to place the interests of the community
above his own. It is quite obvious, then, where these theories differ. The
clashes ensue whenever the rights of the individual conflict with the
"rights" of the community. One faction sides with the individual and the
other allies itself with the community and it is unlikely that this
contentious issue will ever be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. It has
been around, as I said, since the beginnings of American history: from the
United States Constitution and the Charles River Bridge decision of the
Supreme Court to the New Deal and the welfare state. It is with the first
two disagreements that I will focus, but the fundamental issues that arose
in them are still applicable and represent the same issues we face today.
Ultimately, it is the ideas of liberalism that should win out since they 
are more firmly grounded in the metaphysical needs of man, while
"republicanism" is contrary with these same requirements.

This last point definitely begs for some attention. If we accept the Law
of Identity, first enunciated by the great Greek philosopher Aristotle,
which says that an entity has a specific nature that it cannot contradict,
and apply that to the entity <em>man</em>, we see that he has a specific
nature, too. Survival is specific for man in that he must perform a
certain set of actions in order to survive. He cannot acquire nutrition
and energy using the method of survival of the plant, i.e., using
chlorophyll. He must get food and consume it to provide the energy
necessary for continued existence. Food, however, does not just appear in
his mouth. He must engage in a certain species of action: self-generated,
goal-directed action. The goal, in this case, being life itself. Life is
the ultimate value because life is the precondition of all values and that
to which all lesser goals are the means.This goal-directed action
presupposes a process of thought, since it is necessary to detail within
the mind the steps necessary to enact in order to acquire the food.
Granted, the process of thought involved in such an effort is low-level,
but it is most clear at this level. Because a process of thought is
necessarily the precursor to any survival action, we can say that reason
is man's means of survival. A man <em>can</em> act without thought, but it
amounts to mere motion, and a man <em>can</em> think without action, but
it amounts to mere daydreaming. So, more properly, we should say that
reason is man's <em>basic</em> means of survival. On a more advanced
level, this principle still applies. Even in a modern, capitalist economy,
man must still struggle for survival. He must acquire the wealth by which
to purchase nourishment and he must do it through a process of reason.
From the above, we can derive the good. If man is goal-directed and life
is his ultimate value, then life must also be the standard of value, of
good and bad. That which furthers man's pursuit of life, the life proper
to man, is the good and that which hinders his quest of life is the bad.
Therefore, since man has a certain means of survival and the good is that
which furthers survival, we can say that which allows reason to flourish
uninhibited is also the good. This is the derivation of the rights to
life, liberty, and property. Man's mind, his means of survival, cannot
function if man is condemned to death at whim, i.e., if the right to life
is not secured. Similarly, man's mind cannot function if its content or
expression in action is limited or restricted, the right to liberty.
Finally, man's mind is inextricable from man's body, they are an
inseparable whole. Man must be able to occupy corporeal space. Moreover,
man must be able to own the fruits of his mind's labor. How can life be
pursued if one cannot own or ingest the food that one has acquired? Since
man's mind is his means of survival, the restriction of it is certain
death. This also hints at the fundamental evil, the initiation of force.
The initiation of force is the only means by which man's mind may be
limited or constricted. The government exists to secure and protect these
three rights. The principle here is: you can do whatever your mind
requires you to do so long as you do not infringe on other people's right
to do the same through an initiation of force. The assertion that the
government should change its role from policeman to highwayman is
repulsive to the notion of individual rights and reason. A compelled mind
is not free. This is the philosophical support for liberalism. It should
be evident why the abrogation of individual rights, whether for personal
or public gain, is antithetical to man's nature and can lead, ultimately,
only to death and destruction. It is also instructive to understand the
concept of "community" and not attempt to reify it: it is simply a
collection of individuals on geographic grounds. It has no rights above or
beyond the rights of the individuals located within it, nor can there be
any responsibilities of individuals to the community that violate the
individual's rights.

Of the two historical events, the Supreme Court decision in the Charles
River Bridge decision more obviously reflects a clash between collective
and individual rights. A bridge was chartered by the Massachusetts state
government to connect Boston with Charlestown, a suburb across the Charles
River. At the time, however, the ferry had exclusive rights to travel
between the two towns. The Legislature decided that the ferry did not have
a case and enacted legislation effecting the Charles River Bridge
Corporation. It allowed the corporation the right to charge a specific
toll to maintain the bridge and earn a profit. The charter did not
specifically mention an exclusive right to transportation between the two
towns. The bridge churned out profits for the proprietors and their
shareholders and all was well with Boston. By the early eighteenth
century, however, the town of Boston had doubled its population and the
bridge's tolls were becoming burdensome and odious to the commerce of the
two villages. Another corporation petitioned the Legislature to charter
another bridge which would have only have tolls for six years, thereupon
the bridge's ownership would revert to the state. The people supported the
idea of a free bridge and the proprietor's complained loudly. The
Legislature was ambivalent in its voting, but came out in favor of the
free bridge supporters. The Charles River Bridge proprietors promptly
petitioned a court in Massachusetts for an injunction to halt construction
of the bridge. The case was decided in favor of the free bridge and the
proprietors appealed the case all the way to the Supreme Court, which
eventually affirmed the lower court's decision. There were many arguments
used by both sides for support. The proprietors asserted that their
property was not only the actual bridge, but the income generated from the
use of that bridge, i.e., the tolls. Since the state was going to charter
a parallel bridge, alike in just about every respect except for the lack
of a toll, this would deprive the proprietors of their property and would
be a taking&mdash;deserving of reasonable compensation. Furthermore, the
sanctity of contract guaranteed by the United States' Constitution was
also in jeopardy. If the government creates a contract and later reneges
on it without remuneration, the precedent established would be disastrous
for all commercial activity and would decimate the economy. The opposing 
side argued that the public good demanded that another avenue be opened.
That it would be a free avenue for all was an added bonus, regardless of
any one individual's concerns about his property. The state grants
charters and can retract them at will. It was the public's right to
decide, through its voice in the elected representatives, whether, where,
when, and how a new concourse could or should be constructed. They argued
that the public had done so in choosing the Charles River bridge over the
old ferrys and would do so again in the case of the railroads over the
canals. They said that the proprietors' property would be nullified, but
that, since it was for the greater good, it was justified. This was just
the doctrine of "republicanism" with its placing the progress of the
community over that of the individual. The Supreme Court of the United
States decided in favor of the defendant, the Warren Bridge proprietors.
Was this a just decision? Given the nature of man, we can see that the
proprietors' rights were, in fact, being abrogated&mdash;albeit
indirectly. But this conclusion depends on whether or not the proprietors
had an exclusive right to the transportation across the Charles River
granted by the State in the charter. I think that the proprietors
implicitly thought that there was an exclusive right granted to them.
Whenever there is a dispute between the rights of an individual and a
collective, I think that it is important to uphold the right of the
individual, in this case a legal individual (which is what a corporation
is considered to be). As Ronald Dworkin, the famed constitutional scholar,
says, it is crucial to take rights seriously. They are at the foundation
of our form of government and way of life. As such, they are infinitely
more important than any inconvenience caused by a toll.

The Constitution of the United States is a profoundly unique document in
world history. It, for the first time, secures the rights of the
individual and establishes checks against government abrogation of them.
In the form of government it created, there reflected a profound
understanding of the great peril of both majority rule and oligarchy. For
example, the House of Representatives size is determined by the population
of the individual states. This is a truly democratic institution, an organ
for the people. The Senate's size is fixed by the number of states in the
Union. It is a body for the states <em>qua</em> states. By themselves,
they run the risk of either tyranny or mob rule, but together they
establish a powerful check on government power. But the true source of
individual versus collective rights is to be found in the Bill of Rights.
The First Amendment, the long-held bulwark of personal freedom, says that
any person can believe whatever he wants, say whatever he wants, read
whatever he wants, and meet with anyone he wants. The "community
interests" which have been outraged by this Amendment are many: the
Quakers (who were not liked by many Christians), pornographers or
blasphemers, and even the Sons of Liberty are or would have been protected
by this Amendment, much to the consternation of the puritanical interests
of many communities. The cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth
Amendment is likewise important since, generally, the "community" seldom
regards the convicted criminal with benevolence and often sanctions
punishment in the most unjust means: stoning, lynching, mobs, et cetera.
Finally, the Ninth Amendment states that, just because a right is not
enumerated in the Constitution, does not mean that an individual does not
possess it and cannot be denied it. There has been much pressure in
American history to deny individuals rights because they are not specified
in the Constitution. In the century following ratification, the Court
upheld a mostly strict construction of the Constitution, thereby
protecting individual rights. After that, however, the Constitution's
defects began to show. Its protection of individual rights rested on a
foundation that the Founding Fathers declared to be self-evident, but was
anything but self-evident. This left openings which were subsequently
exploited. It is with great trepidation that I say that the collective
rights faction is steadily winning the battle over the United States'
Constitution. Liberalism's defenders are few and ineffectual, while its
opponents are legion. The only proper defense of individual rights is the
defense elaborated in the second paragraph and the "republicans" will
continue to win out until that foundation is adopted.

Throughout American history, liberalism and "republicanism" have contested
the soul of the American nation. Up until the twentieth century,
liberalism held primacy. But it had a fatal flaw. It shared the same
premises of "republicanism" but in a much diluted form. It was inevitable
that liberalism's defects would rear up. I have articulated the only hope
for liberalism that could completely answer "republicanism's" charges. The
philosophic climate is not such that this defense would gain any foothold
in American culture, but it will someday. And then we will regain the
glory of the Industrial Revolution&hellip;

<br /><a href="http://www.dynamist.com/weblog/">Virginia Postrel</a>, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684827603/ref=nosim/dynamistcom/" title="Link credits Virginia Postrel for all purchases, so use it!"><cite>The Future and Its Enemies</cite></a>, has a new book out on style entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060186321/ref=nosim/dynamistcom"><cite>The Substance of Style</cite></a>&#x2014;those links credit Virginia Postrel if you purchase after clicking on them, which helps her keep a little extra in earnings.<br /><br />The book is about the way style has taken on a life of its own. I rather enjoyed her first book, though I occasionally found it tedious in its repetitive distinction between dynamists and stasists&#x2014;a perhaps non-essential cleavage as well, so I think her second is probably worth buying as well. There are some excellent reviews of the book in an interview in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/interviews/int2003-08-27.htm"><cite>The Atlantic Monthly</cite></a> and the <a href="http://daily.nysun.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Path=NYS/2003/09/03&amp;ID=Ar01600"><cite>New York Sun</cite></a> that suggest that her central thesis is about how style has become a "major&#x2014;perhaps the major&#x2014;economic phenomenon of our time." That's a highly debatable point, to be sure.<br /><br />I'll post a review once I acquire the book and have a chance to read it.<br /><br /><br />

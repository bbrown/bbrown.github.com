They asked GOP Congressional leaders for references about the effects of the "millionaires tax." After the leaders failed to produce anyone, they put the word out on their Facebook page seeking self-defined affected individuals and asked for their opinion about the scheme. Unsurprisingly, the individuals who responded were fine with the tax increase, spouting all the standard utilitarian platitudes about giving back and arguing that tax consequences play a minor role in their economic decisions. The conclusion, then, is basically the same as Warren Buffet's: rich people should be made to sacrifice just like the rest of us. (I say "be made to" because anyone can voluntarily send more of their money to the federal government any time they want. These types won't do that, though.)

This is the bed that conservatives and Republicans have made by their half-hearted support for capitalism. For them, capitalism is the system that works.

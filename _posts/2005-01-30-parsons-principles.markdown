<br />As I've <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/interview-with-bob-parson.cfm">mentioned</a> previously, I'm a big fan of GoDaddy CEO Bob Parsons. Well, not such a big fan that I knew he had a <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/">blog</a>. Perusing its content, I found his <a href="http://bobparsons.com/index.php?/archives/19-guid.html">16 rules</a> for survival in business. They're nothing particularly new, but they give some interesting insight into a local success story.<br /><br />Reading that previous entry, I said that I'd work there in a heartbeat if my ASP skills leaned towards .NET. And so now they do. More on that later.<br /><br /><br />

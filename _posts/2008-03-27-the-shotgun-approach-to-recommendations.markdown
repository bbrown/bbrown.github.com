I went to <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> just now to rate a movie I watched. On the front page, the image at right greeted me.
</p>
<p>
You may or may not know, but Netflix is <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">offering</a> a $1 million prize for a 10% improvement in its recommendation algorithm. I honestly don't know if the recommendation at right is what they're trying to improve but if it is then 10% better shouldn't be too difficult.

<p>
I mean, because I liked a documentary about capital punishment, a 80s puppet children's show, and my children liked an insipid phonics teaching program they think that I'd really dig a pseudo-martial arts exercise video. Sorry, but WTF?!
</p>
<p>
They just completed a <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2008/03/netflix-now-wider-more-personalized.html">big ol' upgrade</a> but I think they missed a spot. Yeah, over there. See that recommendation engine-sized dark spot over there. There you go, you've found it.

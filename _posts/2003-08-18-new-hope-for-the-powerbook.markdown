<br />My 500 MHz PowerBook G4 has always felt a little pokey&#x2014;quite natural given its 4200 rpm 20 GB hard drive and 100MHz <acronym title="Front Side Bus">FSB</acronym>. I've looked into upgrading the hard drive (the bus is impossible to upgrade), but never met with any luck or hope.<br /><br />Until today, that is! Derrick Story or O'Reilly <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3671">details</a> his adventures in upgrade land with a bit more advanced of a PBG4 than I have, but more alike than different. The cost is reasonable, doubling the hard drive space and upping the rpm to 5400 cinches the deal for me.<br /><br />A comment after the article links to the <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/Catalog_Page.cfm?Parent=91&amp;Title=2%2E5%22%20IDE%20%26%20SCSI%20for%20Laptops&amp;Template=">specific page</a> at Other World Computing that Derrick visited. For $219.99, I can bring my space up to 60 GB while keeping the speed the same and getting a 16MB data buffer. OH YEAH!<br /><br />I wouldn't even glance at the 7200 rpm IBM drive since it would drain battery something awful. 5400 rpm seems like the sweet spot.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic">Steve</a> suggests that I might even consider buying an external FireWire drive chassis for the old hard drive. This is getting better. It'd be like a whole new PowerBook for just a couple hundred dollars. Oh wait. That's a couple hundred dollars more than I have available for upgrading the computer. Hmmm.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I hate piracy. I own all my software, music, and movies. I don't traffic in those goods either: if I know someone's a pirate, I won't lend him or her any of my media. It's good to know that there are others who <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=7a592614-ff21-4817-b7c0-3ea9a7007122">share my disdain</a>.<br /><br /><br />

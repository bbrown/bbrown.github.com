I used to blog more frequently about working at <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">Go Daddy</a>. My silence has not externally imposed, I can assure you. The dearth of entries is the result of working a lot.
</p>
<p>
When I last <a href="http://bbrown.info/2010/07/work-happenings.html">discussed my job</a>, I was working with the Social Media Team. I'm still doing that stuff&mdash;I do the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/GoDaddy?v=app_6009294086">Fan-Only Content</a> regularly&mdash;but my work life mostly revolves around Go Daddy's <a href="http://www.x.co/">URL shortener</a> X.CO.
</p>
<p>
When I first started working on the product, I held URL shortening in very low regard&mdash;mostly because of <a href="http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/04/on-url-shorteners.html">this blog entry</a> by Joshua Schachter. But I've really come around to see the value in them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>They can act like a domain name where a domain name isn't possible. For example, I can point <a href="http://x.co/bags">x.co/bags</a> to my wife's Etsy shop and she can use that in her printed materials. It's really very convenient.</li>
<li>They really do save characters on Twitter. Many times, the shortness of my X.CO links have let me just write without the constant re-editing necessary for full URLs and longer URL shortener's links.</li>
<li>They can actually combat linkrot, so long as the business providing the URL shortening isn't going anywhere. (Go Daddy, in this regard, is very committed to X.CO.)</li>
<li>Modern <a href="http://community.godaddy.com/godaddy/patching-broken-windows/">URL shorteners</a> do malware and phishing checks on every click. This limits the reach of the bad guys, though sometimes <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/01/21/new-twitter-worm-goo-gl/">something</a> still gets through.</li>
<li>You can see what traffic your <a href="http://twitter.com/billbrown/">Twitter sharing</a> generates. It's nice to see people clicking on the things you want them to.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have had a blast working on X.CO, working with some really great people and doing some of the most challenging, innovative development I've ever done. I have learned so much about <a href="http://www.memcached.org/">memcached</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460717.aspx">parallel programming</a>, jQuery, and multithreading in meeting the needs of a growing user base. (And shutting down the bad guys that want to undermine it all.)

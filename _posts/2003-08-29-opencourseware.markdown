<br />Two years ago, I read about <acronym title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</acronym> open-sourcing its coursework and thought it was a great idea. I went there immediately and saw practically nothing of interest. They've apparently been busy these last couple of years. <a href="http://www.wired.com/"><cite>Wired</cite></a> has a great <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/mit_pr.html">article</a> about how far it's come and where it's going. I may just have to look into it to get the computer science education I never had.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Hmm, the article didn't give a URL for <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT's OpenCourseWare</a>. Weird.]<br /><br /><br />

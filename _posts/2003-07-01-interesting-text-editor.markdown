<br />Billing itself as "the text editor for writers," <a href="http://www.blue-tec.com/">Blue:Tec</a>'s new <a href="http://www.blue-tec.com/ulysses/">Ulysses</a> application looks promising. Running through the <a href="http://www.blue-tec.com/ulysses/screens.php">screenshots</a>, it looks like no other text editor I've encountered and yet it looks inviting. I could see myself writing on this, but why don't they have a way to <a href="http://www.blue-tec.com/ulysses/pricing.php">buy</a> the damn thing in dollars?<br /><br /><br />

<br /><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/overview">Google AdSense</a> is a program whereby Google supplies personal Web sites with text ads relevant to the pages content. I'm <a href="http://google.blogspace.com/archives/001015">thinking about doing this</a>.<br /><br />What do you think? Yes or no? Please express your opinion in the comments. I don't want to alienate anyone and I'm not hurting for money by any means, but I sure wouldn't mind getting some Google revenue&#x2014;my Amazon affiliate has never generated a sale (I still like the information they provide so I'll keep it up).<br /><br /><br />

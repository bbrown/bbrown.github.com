<br />Man, three days spent caring for three sick kids and I totally miss out on the <a href="http://textpattern.com/weblog/11/textpattern-4-stable-released">Textpattern 4 festivities</a>. In related news, I have decided that I'm going to just do it and stop worrying about link rot. That's right, you people coming here via Google searches will have to do without your Bill Brown-love for awhile until Google adequately reindexes (or until I decide to start up the 301 engines).<br /><br /><br />

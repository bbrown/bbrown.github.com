<br />An Apple engineer has written and performed a song entitled "<a href="http://home.in.tum.de/pittenau/ModelViewController.mp3">Model, View, Controller</a>" that is both educational and funny. If you're not clear on the benefits of MVC, listen to this. It's probably the only song that will ever be created with a line like "Model view - mad props to the Smalltalk crew." Hopefully.<br /><br /><br />

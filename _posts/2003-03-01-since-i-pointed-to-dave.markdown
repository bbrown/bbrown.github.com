<br />Since I <a href="2003_02_02_diamonds.cfm#88764048">pointed</a> to <a href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave" title="A little more Mac-oriented than Andy's makes it just a tad better.">Dave Thomas's blog</a>, I should probably be fair to the other pragmatic programmer and point to <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog" title="Very interesting...">Andy Hunt's new blog</a>.<br /><br /><br />

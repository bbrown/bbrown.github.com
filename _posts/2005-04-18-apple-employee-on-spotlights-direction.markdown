<br />I know I said that I was going to take a hiatus, but I think that <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=146369&amp;cid=12266911">this comment</a> and <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=146369&amp;cid=12262787">this comment</a> on the <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/17/139257">Slashdot story about Tiger's new features</a> deserves the widest currency possible. The commenter, <a href="http://slashdot.org/~As%20Seen%20On%20TV">As Seen on TV</a>, is an Apple employee that has been pretty active on Slashdot for awhile.<br /><br />Those two comments describe Apple projects that exist in their R&amp;D labs <em>now</em> and might make their way into future products and OS X versions. Hot damn!<br /><br />[UPDATE: Found another <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=146352&amp;cid=12259952">interesting comment</a> about a new startup method that cuts boot time by 50%.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (4/27/05): Man, I can't believe how many times a day I check this guy's comments. It's incredibly fascinating, like this comment on <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=147467&amp;cid=12355892">Steve Jobs' deserved assholiness</a>. With all the attention paid to rumors and speculation, I can't believe that this isn't more widely reported. I told Kottke, I told MacRumors. I don't know who else to tell. I mean <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=147467&amp;cid=12356022">this iPhoto comment</a> is rumor mill gold, Jerry.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 2 (4/27/05): Here's <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=147406&amp;cid=12359413">more detail</a> about <code>launchd</code>, the startup method in the first update.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 3 (4/27/05): Here's a <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=147508&amp;cid=12359661">great response</a> to why the Apple rumor mill is so damaging.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (4/28/05): Here's ASOT regarding <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=147406&amp;cid=12372921">Linux "innovation"</a>. HINT: he hasn't seen any.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 2 (4/28/05): He's <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=147629&amp;cid=12373460&amp;pid=12373460&amp;threshold=0&amp;mode=flat&amp;commentsort=0&amp;op=Change">admittedly not Steve Jobs</a> but I can't figure out who he could be. His knowledge is wide and fairly deep, but he's seen demos in the R&amp;D lab and been privy to some pretty high-level decision making. It's fascinating.]<br /><br /><br />

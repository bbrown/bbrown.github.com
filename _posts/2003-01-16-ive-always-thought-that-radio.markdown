<br />I've always thought that radio contests were stupid, but in merry old England they're positively <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,874982,00.html">dangerous</a>. It's hard to figure out which party is stupider: the ones who sat on the dry ice or the ones who thought of the idea. At some point wouldn't you say that free tickets just weren't worth it or notice that your genitals were completely numb?<br /><br /><br />

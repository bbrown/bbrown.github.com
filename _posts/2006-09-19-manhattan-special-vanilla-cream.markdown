<p>Coming on the heels of the <a href="/2006/09/18/waialua-vanilla-cream.aspx">Waialua Vanilla Cream</a>, this was something of a disappointment. Perhaps if I had tasted prior to that exquisite one, I might have rated this one higher. As it stands, there was no aftertaste save a hint of vanilla and the mouth feel was quite strong. It reminded me of something that I unsuccessfully attempted to recall while drinking the entire bottle. It's very bubbly, like champagne, and maybe a little tart.

<br />I'm too tired to blog all of the buzz about the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/store/">iTunes Music Store</a>, but there's a ton out there.<br /><br />This entry is to focus on one particular comment and one particular blog of note: <a href="http://billpalmer.blogspot.com/">Bill Palmer</a> and his comment on <a href="http://billpalmer.blogspot.com/2003_04_27_billpalmer_archive.html#93448173">the Third Coming of Jobs</a>. I don't know how that guy writes so much every day and keeps such an excellent focus in each entry. I just wish he had an RSS feed so I could use <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/" title="Best. RSS Reader. Ever.">NetNewsWire</a> to follow along better.<br /><br /><br />

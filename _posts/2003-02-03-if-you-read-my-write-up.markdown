<br />If you read my write-up on <a href="../../values/people/pjorourke.cfm">P.J. O'Rourke</a>&#x2014;and a quick scan of the logs shows that no one has&#x2014;you'd know that I'm a former fan of <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/" title="Read his columns if you can.">Dave Barry</a>. In my comments, I wrote that Dave Barry strikes me as formulaic and that it's really easy to be funny when you can completely fabricate any details.<br /><br />As proof, I submit <a href="http://www.peacefire.org/staff/bennett/autodave/" title="The automated Dave Barry column generator">AutoDave!</a>&#x2014;"The automated Dave Barry column generator." Quickly fill out its form and it will generate an entire column that will easily pass for his dreck. Try it. If you do it repeatedly, you can slap together a book proposal and publish it. It's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?tag=bbrown-20&amp;keyword=dave%20barry&amp;mode=blended">worked for him</a> somehow.<br /><br /><br />

<br />One of my biggest pet peeves has to be diction-related. Choosing the right words is half the battle in communication&#x2014;the other half being arranging them into sensible sentences (<em>i.e.</em>, grammar)&#x2014;and people far too often skimp on it. They choose the hackneyed, convenient phrase rather than their own formulation. Or they communicate through clich&#xE9;, thinking that the familiarity with the phrasings their audience enjoys will translate into their doing most of the cognitive work. Those sorts of things are imprecise and woozy. When I listen to someone, I want to be engaged, to be inspired to ever-greater cognitive heights. Instead, I often trudge through insipid inanities&#x2014;mired down in verbal sludge of vagueness.<br /><br />Yet I still enjoy commiserating about this. <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">Jeremy Zawodny</a> related his experiences <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000940.html">recently</a> but the best page I've found so far is <a href="http://tom.mangan.com/banned.htm">Banned for Life</a>, a <a href="http://www.tommangan.net/">Tom Mangan</a> production (NOTE: he's the guy who did the <a href="http://www.sevenquestions.com/">Seven Questions interviews</a> awhile back). This is a very comprehensive list of things that bother Tom and his readers and I agree with nearly all of them.<br /><br />One of the readers comments, "Do we ever sound so stupid when we try to sound smart?" <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mhear.html">Hear, hear!</a><br /><br /><br />

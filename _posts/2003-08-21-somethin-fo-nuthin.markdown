<br />There's a good <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000341.php">discussion</a> going on over at <a href="http://www37signals.com/svn/">Signal v. Noise</a> about piracy of all varieties and the cultural significance of the attitude that inspires it.<br /><br />I am surrounded by copyright infringers in my life. My parents steal cable, my brother and sister download gigs of music online without blinking, my co-workers trade new software (and music) like they don't have high-paying jobs, and people everywhere clamor for something for nothing.<br /><br />One of these days, I'm going to write a huge ass essay about this subject.<br /><br />[UPDATE: I'm done with the discussion with 102 comments. What a day!]<br /><br /><br />

I've just deployed v1.2.3 of <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/blog/landing.asp">Quick Blog</a> and I feel relieved. I haven't been blogging much either here or at <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/">Found on the Web</a> because I've been furiously developing. It's been a rough few weeks as deadlines passed, features morphed, and frustration flared.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, everyone here's been really supportive and understanding. I figured I would be fired after the third deadline was missed, but that turned out to be paranoid thinking on my part. Everybody just wanted the app released in a good state and as soon as it could be. I felt very reassured and optimistic about the future.
</p>
<p>
So I will resume regular posting on both blogs pretty soon.

I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>. One of the few reasons why I even bothered with dual booting via Boot Camp was so that I could "Watch Now." So purchasing their new <a href="http://www.roku.com/netflixplayer/">Netflix Player</a> would seem like an easy decision. But it's not.
</p>
<p>
This player is really just the <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/why-the-roku-netflix-player-is-the-first-shot-of-the-revolution/">opening salvo</a> for what promises to be a protracted battle. The price is compelling, but there's something missing. I can't decide if it's because it's too tied in to Netflix or that it's too limited in content&#x2014;two sides of the same coin.

<p>
All I know is that I want to be able to watch streaming video from the network sites on my television. And I want to watch the Netflix instant video as well. At this point, the option that fits my requirements is the <acronym title="Home Theater PC">HTPC</acronym> but I don't want the expense, unsightliness, and noise of a full-fledged computer in my living room. The Netflix Player and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">AppleTV</a> are the perfect size and form, but they're not powerful enough.

<p>
Unfortunately, I think I'm going to have to pass on the Netflix Player. Maybe version 2 will wow me.

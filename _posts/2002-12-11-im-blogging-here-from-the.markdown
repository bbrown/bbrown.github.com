<br />I'm blogging here from the <a href="http://www.xusers.org/">Mac OS X Users Group</a> meeting in Phoenix. It's at the Coffee Rush cafe and this place has wireless Internet, which is really cool! There's fourteen people here, all male, and representing many different contexts of knowledge. By my count, there are six <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">PowerBooks</a> and one <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibook/">iBook</a>.<br /><br /><br />

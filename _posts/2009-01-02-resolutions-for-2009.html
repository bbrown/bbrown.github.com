It's time to announce my goals for the coming year. Apparently, I missed last year (even though I did a <a href="http://bbrown.info/2007/12/resolution-recap.html">recap</a> on New Year's Eve). I love making resolutions because they crystallize the big picture plan for the whole year, but I do believe that goal setting is an ongoing process that's part of the general self-improvement that should be a part of everyone's life. So here they are:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="read-12-books">
<strong>Read 12 books</strong>: I'd like to be more aggressive about this, but twelve seems like a realistic number. I don't think I read that many last year cover to cover so it would still be an improvement.
</li>
<li id="settle-down">
<strong>Settle down</strong>: I tend to start new things entirely too often. It's time to stop and focus on a few things. I want to get into some routines and get much of my life on autopilot so I can concentrate my attention on the things that really matter.
</li>
<li id="limit-television">
<strong>Limit television</strong>: I haven't attached a number to this yet, but that'll be the first order of business. I've re-added my halved feed subscriptions since I'm blogging heavily at <a href="http://www.newclarion.com/">The New Clarion</a>, so I've got to cut out some other time sinks. Television fits the bill. I'm going to watch <cite>Lost</cite>&#x2014;that's a given&#x2014;but I'm going to try to pick a handful of other shows and be ruthless in not caring about anything else.
</li>
<li id="adore-sandi">
<strong>Adore Sandi</strong>: with the adoption and ensuing chaos last year, I've really let my relationship coast too much. After 15 years of marriage, that's not unusual but I don't want it to be like that. I still feel a thrill being around her and I can't imagine life without her, but I know I don't convey that adequately. I want <em>her</em> to feel like she's the most special person in the world to me, when all too often I'm the only one that knows that.
</li>
<li id="improve-my-writing">
<strong>Improve my writing</strong>: I think I can write better. By and large, the best way to improve writing skills is by writing more. I'm going to do that, but I think I can gain by being more deliberate also. Start from an outline, ask the metaquestions, and revise&#x2014;things I don't normally do as I dash off a blog entry.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I think that covers what I'd like in resolutions: general statements about this year's direction.

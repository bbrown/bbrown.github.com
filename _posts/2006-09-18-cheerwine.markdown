<p>I hesitated drinking this because I remembered that I had had it before but I couldn't for the life of me recall my evaluation. I don't generally like colas. Now I wish I had bought a few of them! Cheerwine is delightful: slight hint of cherry &#xE0; la Dr. Pepper but not the harsh acidity of most colas. It does have the aftertaste that colas always have, but it didn't seem as bad as others I've had.

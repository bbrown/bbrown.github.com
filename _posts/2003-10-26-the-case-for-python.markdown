<br />I'm trying to decide what language to learn next and I'm really leaning towards Python. I figure that I can master C# at work since the big project relies on it and I'm pretty much done with Java (as much as I like it) because I just can't seem to get any traction on using it. I've heard a lot of good things about Python and the <a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a> seems to have reached stable, mainstream status. Plus, Panther now lets Python into the Quartz graphics libraries, which suggests that Python is poised to break into first-language status in Mac OS X&#x2014;joining Objective-C, Java, and AppleScript.<br /><br />This essay about the <a href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/python-first.html">utility of Python as a first language in computer science</a> swayed me. Perhaps after getting comfortable with Python (and mucking about in <a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a>), it will open me up to getting comfortable with Cocoa and Objective-C&#x2014;my inevitable goal. Plus, there's so many <a href="http://diveintopython.org/">great</a> <a href="http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIPython">books</a> <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/index.htm">online</a> <a href="http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/alan.gauld/">about</a> <a href="http://gnosis.cx/TPiP/">learning</a> <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/librarybook-index.htm">it</a>.<br /><br />[UPDATE (11/4/03): I just found this great series of <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/aboutme.html">interviews with Bruce Eckel</a> on the subject of Python. Awesome perspective!]<br /><br /><br />

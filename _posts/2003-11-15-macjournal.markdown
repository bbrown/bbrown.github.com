<br /><a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/11374">MacJournal 2.5</a>, by <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dschimpf/">Dan Schimpf Software</a>, is now out. The award-winning freeware has gotten significantly better since it now can post entries to Blogger, export to XML, export to HTML with user-designed templates, and can accept virtually any type of image, URL, mp3, or whatever in its text-entry field. This is what distinguishes Mac OS X software from Windows: even the freeware is well-designed and usable.<br /><br /><br />

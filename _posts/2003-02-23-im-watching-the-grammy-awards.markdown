<br />I'm watching the <a href="http://www.grammy.com/">Grammy Awards</a> and the two awards just presented illustrate a striking contrast in our culture: <a href="http://www.johnmayer.com/" title="Official site">John Mayer</a> as Best Male Performer and <a href="http://www.eminem.com/" title="Official site">Eminem</a> as Best Rapper. <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmayer/yourbodyisawonderland.html" title="'Discover me discovering you'"><cite>Your Body is a Wonderland</cite></a> versus <a href="http://www.eminemworld.net/lyrics/theeminemshow/13.shtml" title="'Girl you can jump on Shady's dick'"><cite>Superman</cite></a>. One worships the female body and the other sees women as hoes. One exults in love and the other calls for one-night stands.<br /><br />Let's hope that the <a href="http://www.non-contradiction.com/">Law of Non-Contradiction</a> has a societal equivalent&#x2014;regrettably, I don't think it does.<br /><br /><br />

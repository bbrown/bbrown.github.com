<br />Tonight we were driving home from the Red Lobster stuff-your-crab-hole dinner and we saw that the QuikTrip had regular unleaded! <a href="/values/people/sandibrown.cfm">My wife</a> had been <em>sans essence</em> for the last two three days, walking to work and bumming a ride to get home. Now she's pretty much set while I'm in training next week. If the shortage isn't over sooner, as I think it will be since the relaxation of environmental regulations will allow us to use normal unleaded fuel.<br /><br /><br />

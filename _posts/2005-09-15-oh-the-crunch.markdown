<br />Boy, four days into crunch mode and I'm dragging. I worked 15 hours Monday and 12 hours every other day this week. That's a lot of hours, but it's worth it because a) I'm getting paid overtime (hahah, just kidding), but I am getting paid and b) this product is going to own its competition. The sucky thing about all of this is that so many other areas of my life are sliding: bills are piling up, kids are missing their Daddy, wife is shouldering all the parenting burden, business ideas are falling by the wayside, I've had the same movies in my Netflix queue for a week and a half, my unread entries queue in Bloglines is frightening, and I don't even want to imagine what my TiVo wants me to watch. I guess that's the price you pay for being a dedicated employee.<br /><br />I seriously can't wait till it's released so I can talk about it. I've got so many interesting things to share about its development, nice touches, and thoughtful design. What's even better, we've got a ton of ideas for version 1.1 that are going to be very exciting.<br /><br /><br />

<p>Today Apple announced their <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">BootCamp feature for Mac OS X</a>,
which allows Intel-based Macintoshes to install and boot Windows XP.
Holy ska-moly! This is a huge move. They've even redesigned the <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/epal/bcwl.html">Windows XP logo</a>, creating an "X" out of the negative space. Nice!</p>
<p>I sure hope that this portends virtualization in Leopard. Boy howdy, do I!</p>
<p>[UPDATE (4/6/2006): BootCamp's nice and all, but that virtualization I mentioned is <a href="http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/">available today for $50</a>! The future, as they say, is now.]</p>

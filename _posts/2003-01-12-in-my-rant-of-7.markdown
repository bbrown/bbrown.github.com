<br />In my rant of 7 January 2003, I noted that <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> lacked deep hierarchy in its bookmarks organization. As is the case with the <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20030109071154728" title="And I'm not the only one.">status bar</a>, it's actually a non-obvious feature. When you're in the Show All Bookmarks with a bookmark playlist&#x2014;for lack of a better term&#x2014;click on Add a Bookmark Folder or the little plus sign at the bottom of that area. Bang, you've got a subfolder and you can keep going down. Joy returns.<br /><br />Also, good <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20030111001806613" title="Review of Keynote">review</a> of <a href="http://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a>.<br /><br /><br />

<br />There's a longstanding tradition among the Web savvy that when someone uses your images on another page without downloading them to their own machine&#x2014;in effect stealing your bandwidth because you're still hosting them&#x2014;you're supposed to replace the image they thought they wanted with a really tasteless one. You know, to teach them a lesson.<br /><br />I've always dreamed of someone doing this, but in the going on five years I've had Web sites no one ever has. Last night, I discovered someone that had. (Unfortunately, they did it on January 21st and I didn't get around to messing with them until now.)<br /><br />To <a href="http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&amp;friendID=4314574">Leandra</a>, whoever you might be, I apologize that your friend decided to use an <a href="/images/blog/before.jpg">image of my daughter</a> and that I had to <a href="/images/blog/after.jpg">replace it</a>. If you don't like the picture now adorning your comments, I suggest you complain to her.<br /><br />Hee hee,<br /><br /><br />

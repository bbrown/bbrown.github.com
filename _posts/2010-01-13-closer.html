<p>
I am ecstatic that <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2010/01/netflix-coming-to-nintendos-wii-console.html">Netflix is coming to the Wii</a>. This is the closest I've gotten to <a href="http://bbrown.info/2008/05/missed-it-by-that-much.html">my perfect setup</a>, but it's still missing something: <em>viz.</em>, Hulu, YouTube, NBC.com, ABC.com, Fox.com, and CBS.com. In the long run, I think the Apple TV is the best bet but Apple still hasn't put any serious effort into it.

<br />I've got to tell you raising two little girls aged 4 and 16 days is a whole lot of work! I thought that I'd be able to keep up this blog thing even with the two of them, but it's harder than I thought. Do this mean that the inimitable Bill Brown is taking a hiatus? Is he going to quit blogging entirely?<br /><br />What's with the third degree? I've just been freakin' busy. <a href="http://www.appleturns.com/">As the Apple Turns</a> took a <a href="http://www.appleturns.com/scene/?id=3710">who-knows-how-many-weeks break</a> after having just one kid. I was even able to squeeze out an entry in the midst of my announced blogging vacation.<br /><br />The reason why I haven't posted an update here or on <a href="/blogs/found/">Found on the Web</a> is because I <em>just haven't been doing much surfing</em>. Holding a baby in one arm while trying to type with the other (or even a toe when you're trying to feed said baby) just doesn't work as well as you'd think. As I type, Kimberly is now nestled between my legs, sleeping soundly. I've been catching up on work email&#x2014;172 new messages in my inbox and several thousand squirreled away in folders by diligent rules&#x2014;and updating a few applications (including a security update from Apple).<br /><br />She's squirming around now like she's tired of the clack-clacking of the keyboard. In other words, computing time is <strong>over</strong>. Such is the life of a parent.<br /><br /><br />

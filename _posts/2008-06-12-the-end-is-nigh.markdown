ABC is thinking that we're starting the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=5045549">last century of civilization</a> {<a href="http://austrianeconomists.typepad.com/weblog/2008/06/who-will-be-the.html">via</a>}, which coincidentally is the subject of their upcoming special entitled <a href="http://earth2100.tv/" rel="nofollow"><cite>Earth 2100</cite></a>. Sadly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon-Ehrlich_wager">this time around</a> we're minus one Julian Simon to counter this silliness. It is absurd to me that anyone could seriously believe that we will turn from the rapid march of progress to the descent into ruin in seven years. Actually, that is a possibility if Al Gore gets his wish and we start down the path to a <a href="/2008/03/29/earth-hour-can-bite-my-ass.aspx">90% reduction</a> in carbon dioxide generation.

In the comments attached to this article, there's a great question:
</p>
<blockquote>
When we remove natural resources from the earth, what impact does this have on the insulation between the raging heat of the core and the surface of our planet? I would love have [sic] a scientist's answer to this question.
</blockquote>
<p>
That, in a nutshell, is why I think people will believe anything in this climate change debate. (Oh yes, I said "debate." I know in the current climate&#x2014;pun intended&#x2014;it is positively unfashionable to think the matter is anything less than absolutely settled and beyond doubt, but absent a Global Warming Inquisition I'm sticking to some skepticism. That's the subject for another post.) "crocketteer" asks an ignorant question in an online forum and gladly welcomes a "scientist's answer," presumably in the same forum.

We have here a nexus of ignorance and gullibility at work. People, seemingly, will believe anything if it has the aura of authority and the imprimatur of science. How else can you explain the claim that "Experts say that extreme changes in climate, combined with dwindling resources, famine, war and disease have the potential to create a post-apocalyptic world in less than a hundred years?"

<br />Leave it to Larry Flynt for the <a href="http://www.larryflynt.com/national_prayer_day.html">funniest vitriol</a> about Fox News Channel IgnoPundit Bill O'Reilly. Wait for the image to completely load because the prayer is hilarious. I liked Bill O'Reilly at first, but I quickly came to realize that he's pretty ignorant (or pretty good at feigning it to make idiotic points at the expense of his guests). I don't know that I want him dead, but I would prefer that Fox News yank his program for banality. [from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>]<br /><br /><br />

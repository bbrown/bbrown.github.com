<br />It probably would have been <a href="http://www.lomborg.com/press_release.htm">better</a> to ignore the <a href="http://www.forsk.dk/uvvu/nyt/udtaldebat/bl_decision.htm">findings</a> for the sham that they are. <a href="http://www.reason.com/">Reason</a> has a <a href="http://www.reason.com/links/links011003.shtml">nice take</a> on the problem. I must remember to get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0521010683/" title="Those damned environmentalists wasted no time in mentioning this decision in his reviews. Ugh.">his book</a> one of these days&#x2014;I'm entirely unfamiliar with the latest research in environmentalism.<br /><br /><br />

<p>This is an English soda given to me by my boss, who wanted to see my review of it. Between its national heritage and its billing as a "sparkling grape, blackcurrant, and raspberry juice drink" I had very low expectations going into it. No bad aftertaste, but not so good in the duringtaste. It's way better than any other grape soda, but I'm not a big fan of grape sodas.

<br />For my future reference: <a href="http://www.pmbrowser.info/hublog/archives/000496.html">how to create .ics files dynamically</a>. I had wanted to do this when I owned the pottery studio so that I could make our calendar available dynamically from the database. I probably could have done it easily enough, but I never took the time to look at the format. Plus, I wanted it to be Outlook-able too and that was just the hurdle my laziness needed to shrug the whole effort off.<br /><br /><br />

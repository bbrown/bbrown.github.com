<br /><a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> has an excellent discussion about <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/02/2321248&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=137&amp;tid=146&amp;tid=198&amp;tid=99">data organization</a>, a subject about which I alternate between caring too much and too little. My hard drive is in a varying state of organization depending on the level of importance and frequency of access. The more frequently accessed and the more important the files, the more organized and thoughtful the scheme.<br /><br /><br />

The <a href="http://bbrown.info/2007/03/29/dont-be-a-turtle.aspx">Kathy Sierra saga</a> came to its natural conclusion yesterday, when Tim O'Reilly unveiled <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/04/draft_bloggers_1.html">the Blogger's Code of Conduct</a> complete with rules and badges. (We don't need no steenkin' badges. Maybe we need <a href="http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/airbag/law.php#21914">colors</a> instead.)

<br />I've been out of town&#x2014;and thus largely out of touch&#x2014;for the last week, so I didn't know that <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> was hiring <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> to <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0803a.shtml#au2703">redesign</a> its site. That's very nice; I hope it becomes a showcase of excellent design with a full description of the underpinnings. At the worst, it's going to be better.<br /><br /><br />

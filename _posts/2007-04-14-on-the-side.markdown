<p>
I've started working on a personal project using <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> Web framework. I'm still at the very beginning, but I really like the philosophy and idea behind Django.
</p>
<p>
The URLconf and Views stuff is extremely close to the URL rewriting HttpModule I created for <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/blog/landing.asp">Quick Blog</a>. It's better in nearly every way, but I think I did pretty well considering it was my first pass at the idea and I did some things that ASP.NET applications normally don't do.
</p>
<p>
I'm not going to reveal the nature of the project at this time, but I will say that it will be free, help my fellow citizens inestimably, and will thwart a local municipality's efforts. I will chronicle its development once I'm well underway but I don't want to announce anything when I'm not far along at all.

<br />The one major keynote disappointment that I had was an upgrade for <a href="http://www.apple.com/appleworks/" title="Apple's venerable word processing suite that I've been using since it was a ProDOS app.">AppleWorks</a>. There are some things that you absolutely cannot do (or maybe cannot do well) in AppleWorks: tables leap immediately to mind. It's <acronym title="User Interface">UI</acronym> could also stand some updating to bring it into the modern age. I hope that we won't have to wait until next MacWorld for an update.<br /><br /><br />

<br />Seen at <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/">Alton Brown</a>'s <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/pages/rants.html" title="Sorry, no permalinks.">Rants and Raves</a>:<blockquote>The fact that "Dr." Phil has the number 1 cookbook on Amazon.com makes me want to end it all.</blockquote><br /><br />[UPDATE: I suppose I should elaborate since someone I know liked Dr. Phil's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/074322423X/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Self Matters</cite></a>. I think he's a hack, the Dr. Laura of TV. He takes common sense advice and stuffs it into a gruff, stick-it-to-'em package that delights Joe and Jane Sixpack. <em>Schadenfreude</em> might be a German term, but there's a certain <acronym title="Poor White Trash">PWT</acronym> mentality that embraces it. I guess my disdain stems from the general level of scorn I have for all popularizers of <acronym title="Other People's Theories">OPT</acronym>.]<br /><br /><br />

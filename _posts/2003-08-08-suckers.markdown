<br />Someone at <strong>mtl-hse-ppp201519.qc.sympatico.ca</strong> pulled down 163 pages from 7:03&#x2013;4 a.m. today. They were the entire gallery of <a href="/gallery/bbrown/">pictures of me</a> and all of <a href="/values/">my values</a>. I recognize a sucker when I see one. Given the choices, I have to wonder if I have my first stalker! Luckily, he's in the next country up and I doubt any Canuck would withstand the sweltering heat and humidity we've been having.<br /><br />If this is going to be a regular activity, stalker/sucker, I'll ban your IP. Thanks.<br /><br /><br />

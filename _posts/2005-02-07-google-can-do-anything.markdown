<br />I would be remiss if I didn't let you know about Google's every move&#x2014;that's what fanboys do.<br /><br />But you would be remiss if you didn't check out <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>. It is simply, awe-inspiringly incredible. This is what <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Maps</a> and <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a> wish they were. They are doing some truly amazing stuff behind the scenes.<br /><br />[UPDATE (2/9/05): It's even neater than I thought. Joel Webber <a href="http://jgwebber.blogspot.com/2005/02/mapping-google.html">digs</a> into the source to expose its shiny underbelly. {<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/09/how_google_maps_work.html">via</a>}]<br /><br />[UPDATE (2/13/05): I've shown this new Google property to several people and, to the man, they have said that they'll never use MapQuest again. This is going to be big.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (2/15/05): The <cite>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</cite> blog has some <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/004325.html">comparisons</a> among the search engines' localization features.]<br /><br /><br />

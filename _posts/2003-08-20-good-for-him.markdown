<br />I'm sure his little cart won't last much longer (unless he's filled out all the necessary permits and licenses), but this guy's got a <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/0820sr-gasseller20Z8.html">great idea</a>. I'm sure many would consider him a gouger, but I think he's doing a great thing. As I said, I would gladly pay $4-5 per gallon if I could be assured of a quick supply. Unfortunately, the man's in Scottsdale and I'm not too big on handling gas from a gas can&#x2014;I always end up spilling some on me.<br /><br />[UPDATE: In a somewhat related note, there's a site that tracks <a href="http://www.phoenixgasprices.com/">Valley gas prices</a>. Who cares about price (so long as it's not $10 a gallon), I care about supply!]<br /><br /><br />

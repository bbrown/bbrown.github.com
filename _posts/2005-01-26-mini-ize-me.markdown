<br />I really love the idea of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Mini</a>. Getting a new Macintosh for only $499 makes it almost a no-brainer. With an impending huge tax refund, it seems like an easy way to slide a few C-notes Cupertino's way.<br /><br />But <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">Tiger</a>'s coming in the second quarter of this year. My PowerBook G4 and iBook G4 currently run Panther (OS X 10.3). Sandi, the primary user of the PowerBook G4, could care less about upgrading&#x2014;in fact, she's vehemently (and inexplicably to me) against it. So I've got to upgrade one computer to Tiger and it'd be a shame to have to upgrade a second. So maybe I just wait on the Mac Mini purchase until Tiger is released and comes preloaded.<br /><br />Now I just need to run this purchase by Sandi. Time to marshal all the convincing arguments used to buy the iBook G4!<br /><br /><br />

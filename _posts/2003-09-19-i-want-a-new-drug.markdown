<br />I like the extra pick-me-up that caffeine brings, but I can't stand the side effects like headaches, addictive symptoms, and edginess. <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/articles/0,15114,486995,00.html">Modafinil</a> sounds like a great substitute but I'm not sure what "off label" means. Unfortunately, I have no medical reason to get it and I'm not sure my physician would prescribe them if I asked. Hmm, might be worth a shot.<br /><br /><br />

This is a fascinating, though likely apocryphal, story about Davy Crockett as Representative entitled <a href="http://www.fee.org/publications/notes/notes/notYoursToGive.asp">"Not Yours to Give"</a> that seems highly appropriate given recent events. It relates a dressing-down that Crockett received from a constituent who was disappointed at his vote for paying survivors of a Georgetown fire from the public purse. Other People's Money is never so dear as one's own and politicians have an even harder time managing it than do businessmen.

I'm also reminded of Joe Biden's <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-09-12-biden-financial_N.htm">miserliness with his own money</a> compared to <a href="http://biden.senate.gov/press/press_releases/index.cfm?q=Working%20for%20Delaware" title="Working for Delaware is almost entirely bringing OPM back to his constituents.">his generosity</a> with the taxpayer's.

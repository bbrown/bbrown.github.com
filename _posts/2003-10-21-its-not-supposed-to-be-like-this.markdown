<br />Thankfully, I haven't had to be outside too much because it's been <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/pastweather/85024?stn=2" title="103 degrees! Yikes!">over 100&#xB0; F</a> for several days now. It's freakin' October, Phoenix! <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/local/85024?lswe=85024&amp;lwsa=WeatherLocalUndeclared">Something</a> must be done.<br /><br /><br />

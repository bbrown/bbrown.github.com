<br />I'm pulling the midnight to 8 a.m. shift today so that I can apply some patches and enhancements to our online banking site on top of the normal month-end downtime.<br /><br />I've been completely off caffeine for over a month now, but I had to buy a Mountain Dew because I'm already starting to crash a little&#x2014;to be expected since I've been up since 5 a.m. yesterday. I think that with a month off the caffeine is really going to work.<br /><br /><br />

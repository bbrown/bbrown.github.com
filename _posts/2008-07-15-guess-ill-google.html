The 404 page for Apple's search forums helpfully offers a link to search their forums. If you click it, you get this less helpful screen:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="search_disabled.png" alt="Search Denied!" border="0" width="378" height="180" />
</p>
<p>
I thought I had noticed something missing recently in the discussion forums, but I figured that the search capability was a figment of my imagination. Now I know that it was there at some point and then taken away at some later point. Very bad form!</p><p>[UPDATE (7/16/2008): <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/ann.jspa?annID=639">Oh</a>. They could have at least put a link to that announcement on every page so I would've seen it. Oh. They did. Sorry, Apple Discussions Administrators!]<br />

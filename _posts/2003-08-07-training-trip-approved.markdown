<br />Just got confirmation that I will be attending the <a href="http://www.developmentor.com/us/training/course.aspx?id=100">Guerrilla .NET</a> training in Torrance, CA on 8/25! The training sounds extremely challenging: class runs from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday (9 a.m. till 5 p.m. on Friday), meals are served in class, and you stay at the same hotel as the classes. It is going to be a rock solid week of .NET training and I can't wait!<br /><br /><a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a>, you will always be my true love. This dalliance with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/">.NET</a> means nothing to me, baby.<br /><br /><br />

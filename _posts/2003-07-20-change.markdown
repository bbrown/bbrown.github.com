<br />It's very strange. I haven't been to my grandparents' house since I was probably eleven or twelve. I'm 28 now. The house hasn't changed much since then&#x2014;though, of course, it seems much smaller than I remember.<br /><br />It makes you wonder. I'm pretty dynamic right now. Our house is in a flux and is constantly changing. We're having kids and things will change more. I'm sure that my grandparents went through the exact same things. Is there some point at which I'll become more static? Will my house acquire that timeless quality that they have and my other grandparents had even more?<br /><br />I'd like to think that that won't happen, but I can't really be sure. Will I fight it? Or will I just give in resignedly?<br /><br /><br />

<p>Sold to me as a Mountain Dew knockoff, it is anything but. I guess that it's in the "citrus soda" genre but so is Fresca. While I question the wisdom of basing your marketing on an obscure comic strip that ceased publication in 1977, the taste is pretty compelling. It's not as sugary as Mountain Dew but has a similar mouth feel.

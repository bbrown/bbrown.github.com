When Warren Adelman took over the CEO reins from Bob Parsons, he did a roadshow outlining his big plans for the company. I was giddy with excitement since just the fact of sharing the details of those plans was a huge win for internal transparency. (To be fair, his was the latest salvo in that war as Bob had been holding many town halls in the last few years.)

Since then, the move towards being more open with the world has proceeded swiftly. As noted in today's <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/05/22/a-new-era-at-go-daddy/" title="Even sponsoring GigaOm is a meaningful change...">sponsored post at GigaOm</a>, there is now a <a href="http://inside.godaddy.com/" title="We call ourselves Insiders.">technical blog</a> from rank and file employees such as <a href="http://inside.godaddy.com/bill-brown/" title="Look at that, a link to my personal blog and Twitter account to boot!">myself</a>. Warren's also been speaking with the tech press in a <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/05/11/no-more-breasts-elephants-or-sopa-how-warren-adelman-is-saving-go-daddys-soul/" title="SOPA *and* elephants?!">very frank</a> and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2012/05/can-the-go-daddy-girls-convince-you-theyre-serious.php" title="First external reference to the stadium analogy that I've seen aside from my subtle use in the 'Doing Business' blog entry here.">open</a> manner. And all of that is <em>just the start</em>!

In related news, I just celebrated <a href="http://bbrown.info/2005/05/this-time-with-less-subtlety.html" title="I don't see myself leaving either. The future looks bright!">my seventh anniversary</a> and we're <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/jobs/" title="Literally. We went from 600 to 3700 employees in the time I've been here.">always looking</a> for good engineers!

Code belongs in production.
</p>
<p>
I have had this as my mantra for as long as I've been developing software professionally. Tonight we released a new version of <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/business/email-marketing.aspx" title="Express Email Marketing">my product</a> and so I <a href="http://twitter.com/billbrown/statuses/285421651896717312" title="For posterity!">tweeted</a> it in celebration.
</p>
<p>
That got me to thinking: did I coin that phrase or did I read it somewhere? I often forget some clever tidbit that I've read, so it wouldn't have surprised me to find it in a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22code+belongs+in+production%22" title="Google's not absolutely definitive, but it's close enough.">Google search</a>.
</p>
<p>
But there were no matches! I therefore claim its origin.

<br />Thursday, June 5th, marks the tenth anniversary of my marriage to the incomparable <a href="/values/people/sandibrown.cfm">Sandi</a>. To celebrate this decade of wedded bliss, we're going to <a href="http://www.buschgardens.com/seaworld/ca/">Sea World San Diego</a> and staying in the luxurious <a href="http://www.danainn.com/">Dana Inn and Marina</a>. This may sound pedestrian to you, but it substantially duplicates our honeymoon and seems romantic to me. We would have done more, but Sandi's <a href="/blogs/prego/">pregnant</a> and can't travel by plane.<br /><br />We're due back on Saturday, so blogging will probably resume on Sunday.<br /><br /><br />

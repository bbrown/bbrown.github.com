<br />Bashing Napster, Kazaa ("Best not to mess with karma."), PressPlay, and Rhapsody, Steve unveils the "acquire" portion of <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>'s new "Acquire. Manage. Listen." campaign to replace "Rip. Mix. Burn."<br /><br />Quoting Hunter S. Thompson (whoa!), he announces that he's signed deals with all of the five major labels for a library of 200,000 tracksexpanding dailywith unlimited CD burns, unlimited number of iPods, play on a limit of three Macs (you can transfer registrations), and use in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife</a> applications. All for 99 per track!<br /><br />He's now explaining the value proposition of the new service: reliable downloads (already doing QuickTime trailers), "pristine" encoding, free thirty-second previews (!), and album cover art (!). I'm not sure I'll buy another CD again!<br /><br />You can even browse and search the iTunes Music Store just like iTunes!<br /><br /><br />

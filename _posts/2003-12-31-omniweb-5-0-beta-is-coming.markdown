<br />Just got a word of warning from the <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniGroup</a> people that <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/5/">OmniWeb 5.0</a> will enter a public beta on February 2, 2004!!!<br /><br />Quoth the PR lady: "We WILL, however, be showing off saved browsing sessions, updated bookmarks, page marking, improved shortcuts, site-specific preferences, and more. Oh, and a little thing called tabs that just a few (billion) people have been asking for."<br /><br />OmniWeb has been my default browser since 4.5 came out, even though I really like tabbed browsing. It just wasn't enough to edge out shortcuts and the advanced URL completion of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a>. I can't wait to test it out!<br /><br />[UPDATE: Reviewing the announcement page with a bit more scrutiny, I see that it's going to have the ability to save state (called workspaces) as well as an integrated RSS reader. The <a href="http://macslash.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/31/1712221">discussion over at Macslash</a> brings more details, including <a href="http://mikematas.com/omniweb5/">video of tabs in action</a>. Holy cow! That tab action is sweeter than Safari.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (1/1/04): More pics <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/omniweb5/PhotoAlbum1.html">here</a> and mirrors of the <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/mac_15/omniwebtabs.mp4">three</a> <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/mac_15/shortcuts.mov">videos</a> <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/mac_15/workspaces.mov">here</a>.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 2 (1/1/04): Think Secret has a <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/omniweb5.html">page up now</a>.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (1/5/04): <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/01/04/0759248&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=179&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=190">Slashdot article</a> submitted by yours truly with some interesting information. I sent it in on January 1st, but I guess it takes awhile for them to move on these things.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (1/24/04): <a href="http://yourmaclife.com/"><cite>Your Mac Life</cite></a> has an <a href="http://yourmaclife.com/subpages/qt/sfvids/omni.mov">in-booth interview</a> and demonstration of OmniWeb 5.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (1/27/04): ArsTechnica has a <a href="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x?q=Y&amp;a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;f=8300945231&amp;m=79300053654&amp;p=1">forum topic</a> up that spans four pages and involves <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/">Dave Hyatt</a> and a guy from OmniGroup. Really interesting.]<br /><br /><br />

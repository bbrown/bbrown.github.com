<br />I noticed yesterday that someone had installed a hook or hanger on the urinal wall in our bathroom at work. Now I can understand such a device in a stall on the back of the door since you might conceivably need to stow something off the floor, but I've never seen such a thing in a urinal before.<br /><br />Am I crazy since I generally visit bathrooms unencumbered?<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />I don't normally do those inane profile-type quizzes, but the regional differences in American English has always been an interest of mine. So I <a href="http://www.blogthings.com/amenglishdialecttest/">took it</a> and discovered that I am "80% General American English, 10% Upper Midwestern, and 10% Yankee." This is definitely not accurate because there were a couple of questions where I used two of the options though there wasn't an option for that. For example, I grew up saying "carmel" but I've since taken to calling it "care-a-mel" because that's how the word is spelled for crying out loud. Also, I use "pop" and "soda" pretty interchangeably as I do "puh-jawm-uhs" and "puh-jam-uhs." I picked the one that sprang to mind quickest since that's probably what I'd call it in a pinch, but it left me a little unsatisfied. {<a href="http://www.redmonk.net/index.php/archives/2005/10/21/my-mixed-up-english/">via</a>}<br /><br /><br />

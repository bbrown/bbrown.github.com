<br />Blogging will be sporadic until July 24th. We're going on a mini-vacation to glorious Salt Lake City to visit my grandparents in their native habitat. I'll have dial-up access through Qwest like normal, but I'm not planning on doing much surfing while there. And where there's not much surfing, there's not much blogging.<br /><br />Today, I'm going to be going to an ultrasound for <a href="/blogs/prego/2003_06_29_weeks.cfm#105728188440631126">our adopted baby</a>, getting the ol' Durango tuned up for the road trip, and working on a secret project called Operation Book Proposal (I think I probably should have chosen a less descriptive name). I may get a chance to blog a bit, but don't count on it.<br /><br /><br />

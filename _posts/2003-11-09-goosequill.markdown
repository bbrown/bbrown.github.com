<br />For my future reference, <a href="http://goosequill.sourceforge.net/">GooseQuill</a> and <a href="http://goosequill.sourceforge.net/writer/writer.html">GooseQuill WriterWare</a>. These are fascinating ideas, but I'm not so sure about their implementations. I wish they'd put up some screenshots to give me an idea of how this is such a sight better than a conventional word processor.<br /><br /><br />

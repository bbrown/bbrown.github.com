I'm a fan of <a href="http://instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> the service and the iPhone app. Lately, though I have accumulated a queue of quite-long articles that I can't seem to decrease. I really want to read the content I save for later; this backlog feels qualitatively different from the substantial RSS backlog I've built up in Google Reader.
</p>
<p>
I got to thinking that it'd be handy to listen to my Instapaper items. I remembered the developer's blog entry touting his <a href="http://www.marco.org/2403238331">accessibility improvements</a> and that got me to thinking: why not use <a href="http://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/vision.html">VoiceOver</a>? This seemed like the ideal use since the Instapaper-stored content is primarily textual and simplified. 
</p>
<p>
Sure enough, it was easy and performed beautifully&mdash;enabling me to listen to an article or two while I did the dishes. Here's how to do it:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Set up the triple-tap of the Home button to toggle VoiceOver.
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>Go to Settings.</li>
	<li>Tap on "General."</li>
	<li>Scroll down and tap on "Accessibility."</li>
	<li>Scroll to bottom and tap on "Triple-click Home."</li>
	<li>Tap on "VoiceOver" and save your setting by going back.</li>
</ol></li>
	<li>Open Instapaper and the article you want.</li>
	<li>Triple tap the Home button.</li>
	<li>Swipe downward on the screen with two fingers. This starts the actual reading.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The neat thing about this is that Instapaper automatically saves your place and syncs it with all devices, so resuming where you left off is easy.

[UPDATE (12/18/2012): Other options brought to my attention include <a href="https://github.com/naltatis/instapaper2podcast" title="Quite a bit more complicated than my solution but more scalable.">Instapaper to Podcast</a>, <a href="http://www.voicedream.com/" title="$9.99 says 'no dice' to me.">Voice Dream Reader</a>, and <a href="http://www.graygoolabs.com/readomator/" title="Paid Instapaper subscriber says 'no dice' to me.">Readomator</a>. I still like my way best for the time being because it's free and uncomplicated.]

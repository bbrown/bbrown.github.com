<br />It's time to select a smattering of the weirdest search requests I've received:<br /><br /><ol><br /><li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=can+dustin+hoffman+play+the+piano&amp;btnG=Google+Search">can dustin hoffman play the piano</a>: Amazingly, I'm the tenth result for this search because of a <a href="/blogs/bblog/2003_02_23_diamonds.cfm">blog entry</a> about the Grammys. Unfortunately, I don't think the searcher got the info he or she was looking for.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=chief+executive+when+william+howard+taft+was+president">chief executive when william howard taft was president</a>: umm, maybe William Howard Taft?</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Is+the+American+Robin+of+economic+importance+to+man%3F">is the American Robin of economic importance to man?</a>: I see someone is looking for an unusual business opportunity. Friend, I suggest you look into <a href="http://www.paepublications.com/classified_ads.htm">tiny classified ads</a> instead because I don't think the American Robin is of <strong>any</strong> economic importance to man.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=truth+about+AIDS+monkey+god&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N">truth about AIDS monkey god</a>: This one has got me completely baffled. I'm glad I show up after result 40 in this search, but I'm a little concerned that this searcher thought I was worth clicking on. If you're hear about your monkey god and you want to know the truth about AIDS, please keep moving. It's not here.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=live+pictures+of+a+doctor+doing+a+pap+test&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">live pictures of a doctor doing a pap test</a>: This one sickens me all over <a href="/blogs/prego/2003_04_06_weeks.cfm#200128342">again</a>. I'm glad that I had absolutely nothing to offer this man or woman.</li><br /><li><a href="http://uk.search.yahoo.com/search/ukie?p=height+colledge+english+language+text+&amp;y=y">height colledge english language text</a>: I'm #1! Woohoo! What the hell is this searcher looking for?!</li><br /></ol><br /><br />This is, as I said, but a smattering of the searches through which people find this site. If you've come here via some funny search, welcome! I really hope you find what you're looking for. If you didn't, please feel free to <a href="/contact/">email me</a> and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br /><br />

<br />After reading <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,1408917,00.asp">this article</a> about security on the Mac being no better than Windows, I can't help but note this <a href="http://www.secunia.com/advisories/10395/">recent vulnerability</a> that allows a site visited in Internet Explorer to <a href="http://www.secunia.com/internet_explorer_address_bar_spoofing_test/">make a link appear</a> to go to a trusted domain while actually transferring you anywhere it wants <em>even in the status bar</em>. I tried this out at work and it works quite well. Luckily, the fixes are <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/why/">easy</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/switch/">more satisfying</a>.<br /><br />And <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave</a> <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2003/12/12#aNewSecurityExploit">doesn't get</a> the vulnerability at all. (Here's the original text for when he changes it to make him appear less thick: "As Don recommends, I did a View Source. This is what the URL looks like. With a quick glance it looks like it's from Microsoft, but you're actually viewing a page at zapthedingbat.com. This isn't entirely new. I'm not sure what the %01 is about. I guess it's a problem if it's the action attribute of a form element, where you can't see the URL. Takeaway: look in the Address part of the browser window when you're typing into a form and if it's the wrong place, hit the Back button and resume your life.")<br /><br />[UPDATE (12/15/03): Security pundit Richard Forno has a <a href="http://www.infowarrior.org/articles/2003-08.html">response</a> to the <cite>PC Magazine</cite> article mentioned above.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (1/15/04): January's security update is out and <em>strangely</em> this <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/security/0,39020375,39119095,00.htm">ain't</a> fixed.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (1/30/04): Spoke too soon! Microsoft's got a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;%5Bln%5D;833786">fix available</a>: "Do not click any hyperlinks that you do not trust. Type them in the Address bar yourself." Problem solved!]<br /><br /><br />

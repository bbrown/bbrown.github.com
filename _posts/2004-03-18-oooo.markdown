<br /><a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/">Alton Brown</a>, my <a href="/values/people/altonbrown.cfm">favorite cooking show host</a>, has a blog entry up on his <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/pages/rants.html">Rants</a> page about Martha Stewart (dated 3/14/04 since he doesn't have permalinks). He opines that she should read Ayn Rand while in prison because she and "Howard Roarke [<em>sic</em>] have a thing or two in common."<br /><br />I don't think that Alton Brown is an Objectivist by any stretch given some of the things he's ranted about, but I'm so glad that he's familiar with her work. My respect for him just got kicked up a notch.<br /><br /><br />

<br />This <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,60407,00.html">article</a> on <cite>Wired</cite> is about the internal machinations of Apple Computer from 1987 to 1997. As a devoted Mac user for most of those years, it's good to know that the external confusion of purpose was explained by the internal confusion and dissension. It makes the odd moves clearer and helps me to appreciate how far Apple has come as a company.<br /><br /><br />

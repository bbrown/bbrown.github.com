<br />Here's yet another article about <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> that seeks to understand why it's a success, this time from <cite>Fast Company</cite>: <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/69/google.html">"How Google Grows...and Grows...and Grows"</a>.<br /><br />It's really not much of a mystery why Google is so popular that it's name has become <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/google.asp" title="This particular entry ran the web site afoul of Google's lawyers.">synonymous with search</a>: it returns good results quickly and resists bloat as much as possible. People like that. Of course, I did read the article the whole way, but it was just for the juicy tidbits that journalists love throwing in as filler and I voraciously devour. Honest.<br /><br /><br />

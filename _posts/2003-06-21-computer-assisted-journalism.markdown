<br />Computer-assisted journalism is just a fancy way of saying that journalists can use computers to more effectively report on a subject&#x2014;and not in a Jayson Blair sort of way. I'm sure that that's no newsflash there since reporters usually have strict deadlines that require them to get as much understanding of a subject in as short of a time as possible. Computers and the Internet are surely the most useful means to accomplish that end.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.powerreporting.com/">Power Reporting</a> is designed to facilitate the task for reporters by providing links to useful utilities and articles. If it sounds like a portal, that's exactly what it is. There's probably nothing here that couldn't be found elsewhere, but the value is in its centralization and organization around one overriding end: providing context. As a writer and a blogger, this is largely my end too. Point of fact: I found some new resources in the site's <a href="http://powerreporting.com/category/Beat_by_beat/">Beat by Beat</a> on <a href="http://powerreporting.com/category/Beat_by_beat/History">History</a> that I will use in the future. I also like the <a href="http://powerreporting.com/category/Company_research">Company Research</a> section.<br /><br /><br />

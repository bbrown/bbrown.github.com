<p style="font-style:italic;">
I wrote the following essay for a speech class in 1997 and am publishing it now
because today is the 50th anniversary of the book's publication. I encourage you
to read this fascinating novel. Like it or hate it, it brings a perspective you rarely hear.
</p>
<p>
If I had not read <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite> by Ayn Rand, I can honestly
say that I would not be standing before you today. For me, <cite>Atlas
Shrugged</cite> put into words the implicit philosophical foundation and
values that I had accepted my whole life. After reading it for the first
time, I can still vividly recall the moment of completion&#x2014;I remember
the exuberance and joy of suddenly seeing, simultaneously, the course of
my future and understanding the path of my past. Even after rereading its
thousand plus pages four more times, I still gain new insights and joys
each time I pick it up. And I am not alone in experiencing this sort of
feeling: a study by the Library of Congress pegged <cite>Atlas
Shrugged</cite> as the second most influential book in America, bested
only by the Bible. My reaction to this book determined my career choice
(read: my future) and my acquisition of morality.
</p>
<p>
Philosophy is, or should be, a guide to life. In <cite>Atlas
Shrugged</cite>, Ayn Rand expounds her philosophy, later called
Objectivism, through character development and explicit speeches given by
the protagonists. After reading these aforementioned elements, I was
struck by the anti-philosophical nature of our culture. I could not help
but notice that I had never been exposed to philosophy in all my years of
lower education. I had neither listened to nor talked with anyone who had
ever explicitly recognized the importance of philosophy. In fact, however,
philosophy is of prime importance. As Ayn Rand later said, "The men who
are not interested in philosophy need it most urgently: they are most
helplessly in its power." It was then, at the ripe age of fifteen, that I
determined that I was going to be a professor of philosophy. I have never
wavered from that decision, nor have I ever regretted it.
</p>
<p>
But the fundamental change brought about by reading <cite>Atlas
Shrugged</cite> was not primarily career-oriented&#x2014;it was personal.
Prior to reading Ayn Rand's <em>magnum opus</em>, I had never explicitly
defined my morality, my ethical system. What shreds of morality I had were
disconnected tidbits of common sense and convention. There was, at best, a
hazy definition of what "good" people did. What <cite>Atlas
Shrugged</cite> gave me was a moral system explicitly enumerated and
concretely demonstrated through the book's characters and events. Ayn Rand
believed, as do I (I might add), that while philosophy, in general, is a
metaphysical necessity of man, morality is of particular importance
insofar as it is a guide to the good life. Without going into the tenets
and principles of her ethics, I will just tell you that it defines a code
of selfishness that sets two thousand years of Judeo-Christian tradition
on its ears. The benefit of having an explicit moral code, I have found,
is that you know what is the good in any situation at any time. If
something happens, I must simply apply the principles and I will know what
is the "straight and narrow." Moreover, since you know what the good is,
achieving it is that much easier. Think of what uncertainty in morality
leads to: personal anarchy.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite> is an amazing achievement, being both a
philosophical treatise and a novel. It is splendidly written and
incredibly applicable. I've kept the speech deliberately away from plot
and thematic revelations because I did not intend this speech to be a book
report. This book is at the root of my philosophy and, thus, at the core
of my being. If it had not given me the words to formulate my creed, I
doubt I would have pursued a career in philosophy and I would not,
therefore be taking this class to help me with my speaking style.

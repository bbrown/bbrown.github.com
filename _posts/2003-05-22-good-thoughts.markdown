<br />Good postings on <a href="http://www.tesugen.com/">Peter Lindberg</a>'s blog today on <a href="http://tesugen.com/2003/05/22.html#becomingabetterprogrammer">becoming a better programmer</a>. He suggests doing a mind map of what you regard as important; I've got to look into mind mapping&#x2014;there's too many smart people using them for there to be nothing of value there.<br /><br />Also, if you've got a couple of days to kill, read through his archives. He's been posting thoughtful, insightful entries for years now.<br /><br /><br />

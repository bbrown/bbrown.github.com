<br />I'm a prankster by nature. One of the most fun pranks is making a sign and hanging it somewhere, waiting for the fun to occur. In general, I've had to use Word and AppleWorks to execute my devious schemes.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.stclaire.com/">St. Claire's</a> is a sign manufacturer that has an <strong>awesome</strong> tool for making them online: <a href="http://www.stclaire.com/safety_sign_builder/ssb-panel.php">SignBuilder</a>. The possibilities are limitless and the output is quality PDF.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /><br />

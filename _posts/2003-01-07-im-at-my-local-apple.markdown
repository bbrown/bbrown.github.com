<br />I'm at my <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/biltmore/">local Apple store</a>, having just watched Steve Jobs's <a href="http://www.macminute.com/live.html">keynote</a>. I just downloaded Apple's new browser, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, and I must say that my experience using it is astounding. I'm pretty sure that the people at <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniGroup</a> are in fetal positions because this eliminates a lot of the competitive edge <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/" title="Great browser, I'll have to see if there's any reason to keep it. Luckily, they've got my money from my original purchase.">OmniWeb</a> had and kicks its ass in speed.<br /><br />Also, Apple introduced two new <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">PowerBooks</a>: an aluminum 17" monster and a titanium 12" midget. The 17" one boasts everything I could dream of at a price I paid for mine two years ago. I can't complain too much because two years is way too long for buyer's remorse to have any power, but I still want one bad.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I'm watching the stream of the keynote and I just saw the most hilarious part so far:<br /><br />Jobs says here's where we are for 2003 and a panther stalking through the jungle towards the camera. It looks fearsome and powerful. He then suggests that his competitors <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym><acronym> will possibly ship in 2005 and might slip down to 2006. He says that here's where they are and we see a longhorn bull chewing its cud while <cite>Home on the Range</cite> plays in the background.<br /><br />I'm still chuckling just thinking about it. I love snarky, snipe-y sarcasm.<br /><br /><br />

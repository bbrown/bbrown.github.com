<br />Just got home to find my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife '04</a> package waiting for me. I just finished installing and converting my iPhoto library. Holy moly! <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto 4</a> is as fast as it seemed at the keynote. Startup times are very impressive as well. This is so nice and a refreshing change. One other nicety is that the keyword inspector stays on top while you click pictures&#x2014;I hated it how it used to be, it was virtually impossible to enter the metadata.<br /><br /><br />

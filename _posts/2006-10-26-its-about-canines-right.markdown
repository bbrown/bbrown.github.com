This looks to be a <a href="http://www.dvdactive.com/news/releases/reservoir-dogs-15th-anniversary-edition.html">pretty cool package</a> for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000HC2LEY/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Reservoir Dogs</cite></a>, a movie that I've never seen. Apparently, I'm the only one who hasn't, a fact made painfully clear to me in an awkward interchange with <a href="http://icannwiki.org/Warren_Adelman">our president</a>. It was like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000654ZK0/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Lord of the Rings</cite></a> all over again.
</p>
<p>[UPDATE: In case that last sentence was unclear, I have never seen <cite>Lord of the Rings</cite>. Every time I've ever mentioned that fact I have been met with open-mouth, wide-eyed stares, as if I had just said that cancer survivors should just shut up and move on. (I don't believe that, it was just an example.) I have never seen <cite>It's a Wonderful Life</cite>, <cite>Goodfellas</cite>, or <cite>The Godfather Part II</cite> either. I did finally cave in and watch <cite>Citizen Kane</cite>, <cite>Pulp Fiction</cite>, and <cite>The Godfather</cite> recently. Sucked, sucked, and ho hum. Sorry.]</p>

[UPDATE 2 (7/5/2007): I did finally see <cite>Reservoir Dogs</cite> and I have approximately the same opinion of it that I did of <a href="http://bbrown.info/2003/10/25/review-pulp-fiction-2.aspx"><cite>Pulp Fiction</cite></a>. I didn't care for it: there was some egregious violence and the flashback style is so played out. Maybe it was great at the time, which I doubt, but it's tired now.]

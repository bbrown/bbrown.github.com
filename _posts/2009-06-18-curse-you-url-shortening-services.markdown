I now have a horse in the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001276.html">URL shortening drama</a>. My <a href="http://www.bridgeforsale.com/">Meme Obfuscation Machine</a> doesn't work for tweets. Try as I might, I just can't get something by Twitter's automatic URL shortening. Seriously, what's the fun in Rickrolling someone with a carefully-crafted, seductive URL when it gets turned into <a href="http://bit.ly/NauRm">bit.ly/NauRm</a>.

<br />Yesterday I compared mp3 (192kbps) to AAC (192kpbs) to CD (???kbps) in an effort to decide whether I should re-rip my music collection. Through my tiny <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> ear buds, I couldn't tell a difference between the <a href="http://www.apple.com/mpeg4/aac/">AAC</a> and CD versions of the songs. Amazingly, the mp3 sounded very different from the others&#x2014;I never noticed how much crisper and more staccato they sound. Finally, I tested 128kbps and 192kbps versions of AAC encoding to see if there was a difference between those. To my ears (and on my admittedly low-end audio equipment), I couldn't distinguish the two. Mind you, these were not double-blind tests but sufficient for my purposes. I decided that I should probably rip the CDs at 192 kbps just in case I ever need to play them on better equipment. I've gotten through about 10 or so CDs so far. I'm also putting on cover art using <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/">All Music Guide</a>, which has excellent cover art and a broad selection.<br /><br />In other <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/store/">iTunes Music Store</a> news, there's a lot of buzz around the Web over Apple's announcements. <a href="http://www.whatdoiknow.org/">What Do I Know</a> analyzes the <a href="http://www.whatdoiknow.org/archives/000917.php">URLs of the store</a> and discovers some <strong>very</strong> interesting things&#x2014;like that you can directly access the XML of albums and artists! Elsewhere, <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">37Signals</a> dissects the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000175.php">usability issues of the store</a> and offers suggestions for improvement. <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave</a> is his usual <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/04/30#When:3:35:16AM">smarmy</a> self regarding the announcement. <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/" title="Scobleizer: Full of Himself">Scoble</a> parrots the <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/04/29.html#a2894">Microsoft line</a>. Finally, <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/1045">Chris Adamson</a> dissects an actual AAC file <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3130">to see what makes it tick</a>, hopefully not violating the DMCA in the process! [UPDATE: <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> just posted an <a href="http://features.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/30/1310258&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=188&amp;tid=141&amp;tid=107&amp;tid=187">excellent review of the iTunes Music Store</a>.] [FURTHER UPDATE: Long &#x2260; excellent. Upon reading the full review, I see that it is mostly a bunch of gripes. Well, the comments should be fairly decent at least.]<br /><br />There's <a href="http://www.daypop.com/search?q=itunes+4&amp;search=Search&amp;t=a" title="Daypop">more</a> <a href="http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/track.asp?id=5299892" title="BlogDex">out</a> <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=apple+music&amp;btnG=Search+News" title="Google News">there</a>, but I don't have time on my break to list it all.<br /><br /><br />

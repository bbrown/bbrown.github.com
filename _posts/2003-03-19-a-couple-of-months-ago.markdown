<br />A couple of months ago I learned that <a href="http://www.craigslist.com/">Craigslist</a> had a <a href="http://phoenix.craigslist.com/">Phoenix subdomain</a>. Craigslist is more than classified ads and more than bulletin boards, but along those lines. Apparently, there's also a <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/">best of Craigslist</a> page that is regularly updated with the weirdest and most interesting&#x2014;unfortunately, there's not one specific to <a href="/values/places/phoenix.cfm">Phoenix</a>.<br /><br /><br />

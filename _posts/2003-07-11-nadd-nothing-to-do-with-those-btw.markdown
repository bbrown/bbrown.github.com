<br /><a href="http://rands.jerkcity.com/">Rands in Repose</a> <a href="http://rands.jerkcity.com/archives/000152.html">published</a> an expos&#xE9; of that little known or understood syndrome known as <acronym title="Nerd Attention Deficit Disorder">NADD</acronym> that I found via <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2003/07/11#item2230">Steve</a>.<br /><br />As a content-fire-hose drinker myself, I have to say that I see a lot of me in this post. I should probably send it over to <a href="/values/people/sandibrown.cfm">Sandi</a> so that she can better understand me. The thing I'd have to correct is that the N in NADD necessarily implies computers and technology. Surely, the groundbreaking work that is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000056BSD/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Revenge of the Nerds</cite></a> demonstrated that nerds come in all stripes and flavors. In other words, there are physics nerds, history nerds, biology nerds, fashion nerds, etc. Heck, some cross nerdly boundaries: I myself am a computer nerd, a history nerd, and an economics nerd (among other nerdly pursuits).<br /><br /><br />

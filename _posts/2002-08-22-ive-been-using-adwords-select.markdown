<br />I've been using <a href="https://adwords.google.com/">AdWords Select</a> for the last week to advertise my <a href="http://www.paintinginthepark.com/">pottery painting studio</a> and it has been working well. Click-throughs are at 1.5% on the terms I've purchased and I've spent a little over $1 so far! It helps to buy a general keyword and narrow it through ad copy.<br /><br />I bought "pottery painting" for example and wrote my copy to say "Our northeast Phoenix pottery studio ..." This serves much better than buying "pottery painting phoenix" to achieve the same effect since the former keywords are much more used. Yay!<br /><br />My longer term strategy is to get rid of the Fuseboxing and use straight CFMX pages instead. Not difficult to do, but time consuming since each page will have to be re-composed. Also, must remember to plan for contingencies&#x2014;old links, bookmarks, etc.<br /><br /><br />

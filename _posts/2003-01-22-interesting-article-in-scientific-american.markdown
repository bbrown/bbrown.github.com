<br />Interesting article in <a href="http://www.sciam.com/"><cite>Scientific American</cite></a> entitled <a href="http://sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=0002A353-C027-1E1C-8B3B809EC588EEDF&amp;catID=2">The Reality of Race</a>. This is something that I'll have to think about seriously. I still don't think it's important (or should be important, to be more precise), but I always thought of it as devoid of any genetic basis.<br /><br />Good <a href="http://sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=0002A353-C027-1E1C-8B3B809EC588EEDF&amp;catID=2&amp;pageNumber=2">quote</a> from sociologist Duster: "It's a tightrope between trying to rescue the importance and meaning of research on race without giving it a false reality."<br /><br /><br />

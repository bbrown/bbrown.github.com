<br />Excellent <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/Choose_Your_Competition.html">article on entrepreneurship</a> from <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/">Eric Sink</a>.<br /><br />I really like the idea that competition isn't an automatic barrier to entry. That's easy to remember from an economic standpoint, but very difficult to believe. When you see competition&#x2014;no matter how inept&#x2014;it's hard to visualize how you're going to bring something new to the table that the competition won't just immediately copy.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.corante.com/bottomline/" title="Corante's The Bottom Line">Arnold</a> <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/" title="EconLog">Kling</a> makes a similar point in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738207748/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Under the Radar</cite></a> about how upstarts usually lack the encumbrances of existing codebases and processes of an established competitor. His point is that these upstarts&#x2014;flying under the radar&#x2014;can do a better job at serving the customers and can often unseat the competition at its own well-established game. It's a very good book, by the way, though it could have been half as long if he had trimmed out the repetition of his war stories.<br /><br />I especially like Sink's formulation that "The existence of a competitor indicates the existence of paying customers."<br /><br />[He also has another neat <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/Iceberg.html">article on feature creep</a>.]<br /><br />[UPDATE: <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/" title="Where Free Markets Meet Technology. Oh yeah!">Tech Central Station</a> also has another good <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/techwrapper.jsp?PID=1051-250&amp;CID1051-043003D">article on entrepreneurship</a> out that I forgot to link to earlier in the month.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />Quote from John Kerry's <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/pressroom/speeches/spc_2004_1103.html">concession speech</a>: "But in an American election, there are no losers, because whether or not our candidates are successful, the next morning we all wake up as Americans. And that&#x2014;that is the greatest privilege and the most remarkable good fortune that can come to us on earth."<br /><br />If only we had a politician who really understood what it means to be an American instead of one just mouthing bromides while acting to undercut everything that's great about America.<br /><br /><br />

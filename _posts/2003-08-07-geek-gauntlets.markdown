<br /><a href="http://www.ericsinks.com/">Eric Sinks</a> has a new feature up entitled "<a href="http://software.ericsink.com/Geek_Gauntlets.html">Geek Gauntlets</a>." I only had time to skim it, but it looks like another great article. Between him and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>, I'm pretty much set for reading about software development (from a general perspective, of course).<br /><br /><br />

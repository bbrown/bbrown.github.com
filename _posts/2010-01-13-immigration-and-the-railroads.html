<p>
The last half of the nineteenth century experienced a level of immigration
unprecedented in American history. America at the time was a land of
opportunities for everyone, immigrants included. Per capita gross national
product rose at an average annual rate of 2%. Real gross national product
grew at an annual average rate of 4%.<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a>
To illustrate the dramatic increase, historian Robert Higgs compared
America's progress to other advanced industrial nations: "In 1870, after
several decades of industrial growth, the United States had a
manufacturing output equal to that of France and Germany combined, but
only about three fourths as large as that of the United Kingdom; by 1913
the American manufacturing output equaled that of France, Germany, and the
United Kingdom combined!"<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a> A total of
more than 28 million immigrants made the trip to America between 1865 and
1915 in order to participate in this economic prosperity.<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a>
</p>
<p>
Much of this fantastic growth came about because of the railroads. This
half century saw the rise of four transcontinental railroads where none
had existed previously.<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a> Total mileage
expanded from 52,922 in 1870 to 166,703 in 1890.<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a>
Passenger and freight traffic reached ever-climbing heights: 7.7 billion
passenger miles in 1882 and 12.5 billion passenger miles by 1890; 39.3
billion and 79.2 billion ton-miles in 1882 and 1890, respectively.<a href="#6" class="footnote">6</a>
These numbers indicate a significant infusion of the railroads into
American life. They also hint at the transformation of American life by
the railroads. With the huge increase in passenger and freight traffic,
the country got smaller&mdash;people could travel readily and goods could
be shipped over great distances. The railroads' growth also presented a
serious problem for the railroads: their tracks stretched across vast
expanses of unsettled country, an area that generated no traffic.
</p>
<p>
To that end, the railroads expended tremendous energy in an attempt to
settle the lands adjacent to their tracks. Most of the transcontinentals
enjoyed significant land holdings granted to them by the federal
government. The smaller railroads, both regional and local, also received
land grants from the states. In addition to all this government-granted
land, this was also an era of government sales of land to private
citizens. The railroads attempted to facilitate settlement of all of these
types of land grants. Previous settlers had to travel to these lands by ox
and cart. Settlers of this period could count on railroad transportation
to get them to this cheap land. The frontier of America was drawn closer
for the immigrants by the railroads, thus attracting a more diverse group
of settlers who had a greater chance of successfully arriving than the
previous settlers.
</p>
<p>
This, then, is the background in which we find ourselves. It is my
contention that the railroads contributed to the increased immigration of
the time both through the direct actions of the roads' immigration bureaus
as well as the indirect benefits of cheap land and transportation. This
essay will examine the efforts of two transcontinental railroads, the
Northern Pacific and the Great Northern, to attract and settle both
immigrants and migrants in the American Northwest during the last three
decades of the nineteenth century. We will primarily examine immigrants of
German and Scandinavian descent, since those are the two dominant groups
that came to that region. This essay will also integrate the views and
perspectives of some important immigration historians with the subject of
immigration and the railroads. There are some underlying problems with
this subject. First, there has been very little written on this topic.
There have been plenty of brief mentions in books on the railroads, but
nothing done in a systematic fashion&mdash;examining railroad records,
Census data, and other contemporary sources&mdash;and nothing written
since 1956. Second, this is a huge subject. The scope of this topic could
easily be expanded by including more railroads, more immigrant groups, and
more regions. This essay will not provide that systematic examination of
the issue, but it will compile the available information into a summary
presentation about one particular railroad in one particular region.
</p>
<p>
The Northern Pacific, which was chartered in 1864 to build a line from
Lake Superior to the Puget Sound (completing it in 1883), received a very
generous land grant from Congress in order to complete its mission.<a href="#7" class="footnote">7</a>
It was given every other section within twenty miles of its tracks in
states and within forty miles of its tracks in the territories. With the
addition of an indemnity limit of ten additional miles on each side to
account for already-granted or state lands, this meant that the Northern
Pacific owned substantial land holdings in a strip of land that varied
from sixty to one hundred miles wide across the northern part of the
country.<a href="#8" class="footnote">8</a> It was with this land that the
Northern Pacific hoped to attract settlers from around the world, since
its officers knew that, as historian Mark Wyman put it, "on land rested
status; from land came dignity."<a href="#9" class="footnote">9</a>
</p>
<p>
Although the Northern Pacific did not take possession of its
government-granted lands until 1872, plans were well underway by 1871.<a href="#10" class="footnote">10</a>
A Land Committee was formed with the Northern Pacific's future president,
Frederick Billings, as its chairman. The Land Committee then selected as
Land Commissioner (head of the Land Department) John S. Loomis, who was
then president of another land development company. The Land Department
was headquartered in New York&mdash;in the headquarters of the Northern
Pacific&mdash;and St. Paul, and it had district offices throughout the
land it would eventually help to populate. In February of 1871, Loomis
drew up a plan for the operations of the Land Department at the behest of
the Land Committee.<a href="#11" class="footnote">11</a>
</p>
<p>
The Land Department as envisioned by Loomis chiefly promulgated publicity.
They developed maps and materials about the Northern Pacific (NP) in many
different languages for distribution throughout the world by NP agents and
United States consulates. The department also sought to cultivate
relationships with the domestic and foreign press in an effort to develop
outlets for distributing friendly publicity (or at least keep out negative
publicity). It fostered good relations with professional, religious, and
fraternal organizations in both America and Europe to enlist the support
of those organizations' leaders in promoting the settlement of the
northwestern United States.<a href="#12" class="footnote">12</a> Through
these means, it sought to establish a continuous flow of immigrants and
migrants across its territory. Shortly after the establishment of the Land
Department, the Northern Pacific set up an Immigration Department. It had
as its head Major George B. Hibbard, a colorful figure of tireless energy,
and its European headquarters in London, with branches in Liverpool,
Germany, Holland, and the Scandinavian countries.<a href="#13" class="footnote">13</a>
</p>
<p>
Foreign promotion skyrocketed after Henry Villard took control of the
Northern Pacific in 1881. In addition to the branch offices, there were
hundreds of NP agents throughout Europe.  By 1882. there were 83 local
agents throughout Great Britain disseminating NP pamphlets and marketing
materials. That number had risen to 831 by 1883! There were an additional
124 agents spread throughout Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland,
Switzerland, and Germany.<a href="#14" class="footnote">14</a> These
foreign NP agents acted in much the same manner as the steamship agents
mentioned by Mark Wyman in his book <cite>Round-Trip to America</cite>. As
with the steamship company agents he cites, the Northern Pacific's men
used their personal and professional contacts to encourage immigration.
They answered their countrymen's anxious questions, distributed
literature, and arranged transportation for the long journey abroad.
</p>
<p>
Because the journey was so long and complicated, these agents worked
closely with the steamship companies. Competition among the railroads was
intense and local agents were not above "redirecting" immigrant parties to
other railroads.<a href="#15" class="footnote">15</a> By maintaining
friendly relations with the steamship companies, the Northern Pacific
could insure that the immigrant families, once put on the right ship,
would be directed to the NP agent at the end of the journey. The steamship
companies, for their part, wanted to remain cordial because they sought to
avoid the Northern Pacific from aligning itself too closely with rival
lines. The Cunard lines, for example, offered to distribute NP literature
through its agents in exchange for its non-alignment.<a href="#16" class="footnote">16</a>
Occasionally, the Northern Pacific used steamship company agents as its
own local agents. The Immigration Bureau used the National Steamship
Company's agent in Norway and the Allan Company's agents in Sweden and
Denmark.<a href="#17" class="footnote">17</a> There were no conflicts of
interest because all parties wanted immigrants to cross the
Atlantic&mdash;the Northern Pacific could not transport them over the
water and the steamship companies could not transport them over land.
</p>
<p>
The railway's foreign agents were very active in organizing immigration
colonies. A Scandinavian minister by the name of Tustin traveled
throughout Scandinavia in 1872 for the Northern Pacific. He persuaded
ministers in the Church of Sweden and the Swedish Baptists to lead groups
of immigrants to Minnesota as well as several other clergymen in Norway
and Denmark to do the same.<a href="#18" class="footnote">18</a> The
Northern Pacific in 1872 selected as its agent for Hereford, England the
organizer of a farm labor movement which resulted rapidly in almost a
hundred new immigrants.<a href="#19" class="footnote">19</a> Another
important NP agent around this time was Colonel Hans Mattson, who had
written a book in Swedish about Minnesota's opportunities. In 1873, he
acted as the NP agent in Norway and Sweden&mdash;a great coup for the
Northern Pacific, given his knowledge of the area and his patent
boosterism&mdash;until he led a party of 200 from Sweden bound for
Minnesota.<a href="#20" class="footnote">20</a>  O.J. Johnson, agent for
Norway and Sweden, in 1880 distributed over 40,000 pamphlets about North
Dakota's wonders and circulars numbering in the hundreds of thousands,
before leading a group of over three hundred Scandinavians to North
Dakota.<a href="#21" class="footnote">21</a>
</p>
<p>
Interregional migration was important to the Northern Pacific as well. It
focused efforts towards attracting veterans of the Civil War. Major
Hibbard, himself a veteran, traveled across New England promoting the NP's
colonization agenda to Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) posts. His efforts
paid off. In addition to increased veteran migration, Congress in 1872
passed legislation increasing the amount of government land within the
railroad grant that a Civil War veteran could purchase from 80 to 160
acres and counting the veteran's service time towards the five-year
residency requirement, a move encouraged by Hibbard through the
circulation of a petition among every GAR post in the country.<a href="#22" class="footnote">22</a>
Hibbard also organized the New England Military and Naval Bureau of
Migration in Boston. That organization advertised in thirty different
journals and circulated five thousand copies of the <cite>Homestead
Journal</cite>, its publication. These efforts were not unique to the
Northern Pacific, since the veterans represented an ideal demographic for
colonization efforts, but none were as active as the NP.<a href="#23" class="footnote">23</a>
</p>
<p>
Another means by which the railroad promoted settlement was the rewarding
of third parties for their efforts towards the same end. The Land
Commissioner in 1881 suggested that the Northern Pacific could greatly
supplement it efforts by paying commissions to anyone who would help sell
company land. The company agreed and authorized the payment of a 5%
commission on sales up to 160 acres with the condition that the purchaser
had to settle on the land and farm twenty acres each year for two
years&mdash;a provision added to discourage speculation, a rampant problem
for the railroads. In 1883, commissions were liberalized somewhat so that
they were paid on purchases up to 640 acres.<a href="#24" class="footnote">24</a>
These commissions enlisted thousands of private citizens towards the cause
of settlement of NP lands through the use of the profit motive as an
incentive and it paid off.
</p>
<p>
In order to encourage the immigrants and migrants to use its trains and to
purchase lands adjacent to its tracks, the Northern Pacific enacted
special fares and promotions. It sold exploration tickets at full fare,
but credited the price of the fare towards the purchase price of land
bought from the company within sixty days at up to forty acres. Once they
purchased the land, the Northern Pacific provided free transportation for
them, their families, and their belongings. Finally, parties of five or
more received reduced fares when traveling to purchase company or
government land.<a href="#25" class="footnote">25</a> The Northern Pacific
also extended special accommodations to land purchasers. Settlers could
purchase land on credit, paying an additional 7% in interest annually over
a period of seven years. Or, settlers could improve on the land before it
was available for sale and purchase it at the original price once it
became available.<a href="#26" class="footnote">26</a>
</p>
<p>
The Northern Pacific also built facilities to house the settlers while
they surveyed available land. In Minnesota, these houses were equipped to
comfortably shelter several hundred people. They offered health care
through a company hospital, foodstuffs at cost, and beds for free.<a href="#27" class="footnote">27</a>
In Spokane Falls, Washington, the town built a large house along similar
lines with company help and instructed the citizens to brush up on facts
about the area in order to further town development.<a href="#28" class="footnote">28</a>
</p>
<p>
The other northern transcontinental railroad, the Great Northern Railway,
was built north of the Northern Pacific, sandwiched between the latter's
tracks and the Canadian border. Its path was started in 1878 in St. Paul,
Minnesota and finished in 1893 in Seattle, Washington.<a href="#29" class="footnote">29</a>
The principal architect of the Great Northern was its president, James J.
Hill. Hill recognized the need for a railroad in that part of Minnesota
while he was owner of a steamboat company: "More than anything else
&hellip; it was the growing stream of immigrants to the Red River country,
which seemed to almost ready to back up all the way to the East Coast for
want of adequate transportation to the valley, that caught Hill's
imagination." Hill was prescient in his dreams, perceiving what "few
others were aware of and none articulated: a railroad into the valley
could save settlers not just a few months, but virtually an entire year."<a href="#30" class="footnote">30</a>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the Great Northern Railway lacked the Northern Pacific's
substantial land grants. Its predecessor company, the St. Paul &amp;
Pacific, had been given a state land grant of 2.46 million acres wholly
within the state of Minnesota&mdash;relatively small when compared to the
Northern Pacific's 47 million acres.<a href="#31" class="footnote">31</a>
Fortunately, the lands were in the very fertile Red River Valley and
directly adjacent to the tracks. That meant that in its base state of
operations&mdash;Minnesota&mdash;the company would be able to sell huge
tracts of land and promote farming through cheap land prices, but in the
rest of the territory it traversed&mdash;the Dakotas, Montana, Idaho,
Washington, and Oregon&mdash;it would have to employ other means to
encourage settlement and create traffic.
</p>
<p>
Hill and company were up to the task. It was certainly going to have to
accomplish a momentous feat:
</p>
<blockquote>
With only slight exaggeration, <cite>Northwest Magazine</cite> reported
that the new transcontinental ran 1,500 miles through a wild country with
only three "important" freight-producing centers&mdash;Kalispell, Bonners
Ferry, and Spokane. A few branch lines in North Dakota were generating
traffic, but the task of attracting settlers to much of that state and to
Montana remained; Idaho was lightly populated, and except for the coastal
areas, Washington was pretty much an open opportunity. If the GN were to
prosper, millions of acres of land would have to be occupied and
businesses of all kinds would have to be established.<a href="#32" class="footnote">32</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
In 1882, the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba (StPM&amp;M)&mdash;the
immediate predecessor to the Great Northern&mdash;published its first
newsletter touting the advantages of the Northwest and distributed 100,000
copies in North America and northern Europe. He also enlisted an agent in
Norway and Sweden, countries which dispatched immigrants by the tens of
thousands.<a href="#33" class="footnote">33</a> At the turn of the
century, the Great Northern offered immigrants low transatlantic fares
through special deals with the shipping lines and special fares so that
they could bring their families and belongings&mdash;rates ranging from
$22.50 to $50 to rent a part or all of a boxcar. Historians have estimated
that over 250,000 people poured into North Dakota during the last decade
of the nineteenth century.<a href="#34" class="footnote">34</a> His and
the Northern Pacific's efforts were so successful that the first North
Dakota census in 1890 showed that 43% of the population were foreign-born!<a href="#35" class="footnote">35</a>
</p>
<p>
By 1894, the Great Northern had a little over one million acres of grant
land to be sold. It began advertising the federal and state land adjoining
its tracks, as well as some private lands owned by cattlemen and others.<a href="#36" class="footnote">36</a>
The Great Northern's General Immigration Agent Max Bass was very
aggressive in marketing these lands: advertising in all manners of
periodicals, talking up the prospects to farmers at fairs and exhibitions,
and attending church meetings to drum up interest.This last effort was
successful: he had settled almost 11,000 German Baptists in North Dakota
by 1900.<a href="#37" class="footnote">37</a> The Great Northern's
successes in North Dakota were duplicated across the rest of its line.
</p>
<p>
Colonization by the Northern Pacific and Great Northern railroads have, as
mentioned earlier, received scant attention by historians&mdash;at least
relative to their importance in the development of the Northwest. The
overall field of immigration history is, on the other hand, prodigious in
scope and detail. In an effort to bridge some of the gap, let us look at
the history of these two railroads influence on immigration from the
perspective of these immigration historians by applying their questions
and findings to the present subject. For each historian, I will briefly
summarize his or her main line of argument and then integrate that with
the information presented in this paper.
</p>
<p>
The first historian under consideration is Mark Wyman, whose 1993 book
<cite>Round-Trip to America: The Immigrants Return to Europe,
1880-1930</cite> has a direct bearing on our subject matter. In that book,
Wyman argues that immigration to America was really a "two-way migration"
in that millions of immigrants never intended to permanently stay in the
United States. They came to America because of its heightened economic
opportunities, and they left as soon as they had collected enough money to
achieve whatever goals with which they set out. However, those that
settled in northwestern America tended to remain for the long haul. They
purchased land here, rather than working to purchase land in their
homeland. Remigration from the Northwest probably amounted to
little&mdash;data is not available&mdash;due to the nature of the economic
opportunities in that region of America: farming is not rewarding in the
short-term, which is the type of opportunity immigrants intent on
returning to their countries sought.
</p>
<p>
Jose Moya's <cite>Cousins and Strangers: Spanish Immigrants in Buenos
Aires, 1850-1930</cite> also has some relevance to our subject. His 1998
book is a weighty examination of the chain migration from Spain to Buenos
Aires, Argentina that took place during an eighty-year period, a migration
which he contends was mightily influenced by global forces.<a href="#38" class="footnote">38</a>
The chain migration, he writes, "resembled more webs or unending branches
than a chain."For Moya, this chain or web that influenced migration was
paramount, becoming "autonomous" and "self-perpetuating."<a href="#39" class="footnote">39</a>
While there were certainly elements of chain migration occurring in the
settlement of the Northwest, the immigration was much more pronounced.
Rather than a stream of immigrants pouring into the Northwest on the
recommendations of those already settled, significant chunks of foreign
communities were persuaded to transport themselves <em>en masse</em> to
the New World. Efforts by the railroads' immigration agents were far more
important than missives sent to relatives back home&mdash;as far as is
known today.
</p>
<p>
Rudolph Vecoli's influential 1964 article "The <em>Contadini</em> in
Chicago: A Critique of The Uprooted looked at Italian immigrants in
Chicago during the late nineteenth century. On the face of it, a study of
Italians in Chicago seems to have nothing in common with a study of
Scandinavians in the rural Northwest. However, the <em>contadini</em> were
agricultural peasants in Italy and the Scandinavian immigrants tended to
be of that makeup as well. His central argument is that "the
<em>contadini</em> of the Mezzogiorno &hellip; came to terms with life in
Chicago within the framework of their traditional pattern of thought and
behavior."<a href="#40" class="footnote">40</a> The Scandinavian settlers
tended to cluster with their fellow countrymen. It is unclear whether they
faced the same external impetuses to assimilate as did the
<em>contadini</em>, but their clustering did engender retention of
traditional elements of their culture, such as language and dress.
</p>
<p>
Russell Kazal's 1995 review of the evolving definition of assimilation
illustrates another area that merits future attention by scholars. In
"Revisiting Assimilation: The Rise, Fall, and Reappraisal of a Concept
in American Ethnic History," Kazal opines that it is "most useful to
define assimilation in the immigrant context as referring to processes
that generate homogeneity <em>beyond</em> the ethnic-group level."<a href="#41" class="footnote">41</a>
This is an intriguing notion since, as mentioned previously, new
immigrants tended to cluster in ethnic enclaves with those of similar
stock. Unfortunately, it was well beyond the scope this inquiry to examine
the history of relations among the peoples of this region. Given the
remoteness and wide dispersion of the region's inhabitants, a study of the
interaction between the different groups as well as with society-at-large
would be difficult yet extremely interesting.
</p>
<p>
Another work with similar applicability that suffers from unavailable data
is James Gregory's <cite>American Exodus: The Dust Bowl Migration and Okie
Culture in California</cite>. The Okies migrated to California from
Oklahoma because of the latter's dwindling economic opportunities. Once
there, the Okies faced discrimination and economic hardship from the
native Californians. Many of the native-born American migrants moved to
the Northwest for its abundant land and agricultural opportunities. It is
doubtful that they experienced much, if any, discrimination, though,
because of the prevalent boosterism of the times. Incoming migrants and
immigrants were welcomed by the innumerable towns of the interior since
they represented progress and prosperity.
</p>
<p>
Ewa Morawska's article "In Defense of the Assimilation Model" issues a
call for the historicization of the assimilation model&mdash;moving away
from the universal model of assimilation to one that separates
assimilation by time and place. She argues that the classical assimilation
model espoused by Milton Gordon should be recast into three stages:
"integration into primary social relations with the dominant group
&hellip; ; the disappearance of a collective (group) identity; and
finally, concluding the process, the extinction of individual or
subjective ethnic identification."<a href="#42" class="footnote">42</a>
Her staging schema certainly provides an interesting renovation of the
assimilation model and I would second her urging of scholars to
periodicize this new model&mdash;noting that this period and this region
would make an excellent starting point.
</p>
<p>
There have also been a number of studies on the subject of the children of
immigrants. Herbert Gans works on second-generation decline and symbolic
ethnicity, Alejandro Portes and Miz Zhou's article on segmented
assimilation and the second generation, and Junot D&iacute;az's novel
about his experiences as a second-generation Dominican immigrant all are
important works in immigration history. Unfortunately, they deal almost
exclusively with the second generation of immigrants&mdash;a subject
beyond the purview of this summary presentation. They raise interesting
considerations for those who would study the progeny of immigrants that
settled the Northwest.
</p>
<p>
As noted in earlier comments, this time and place in American history
bears further scrutiny. Efforts have been made to understand the region's
history of immigration, but they are incomplete in many areas. The
railroad, though largely outdated as a means of transportation and hidden
in the shadows of America's economy, still offers many lessons about
America's past, present, and future. It is a shame that it goes unexplored
while historians turn their attention to minutiae and trivia.

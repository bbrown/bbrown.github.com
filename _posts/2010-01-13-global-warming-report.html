If you read only the major newspapers and watched only the network news,
you would believe that global warming is unquestioned and as certain as
any other scientific conclusion. Do a little probing and you quickly
discover the wealth of contrarian views available. There are web sites
devoted to debunking the mainstream media's sacred cow, respectable books
by prominent authors, and scholarly articles chock full of doubts. This
would all be interesting diversion and debate were it not for the policy
implications present. If the federal government believes the global
warming hype, actions could be taken that would cripple the economy and
lower our standard of living. It is thus important to discover which side
is right.
</p>
<p>
The basic claim by proponents of global warming is that greenhouse gases
like carbon dioxide and methane are building up in the atmosphere. This
buildup, called the greenhouse effect, traps ultraviolet radiation and its
consequent heat in the lower reaches of the atmosphere, causing the global
temperatures to rise. This rising temperature leads to desertification,
food shortages, and melting of the polar ice caps. Millions of people die
from starvation and drowning. Supporters of this scenario call for
government-mandated carbon dioxide emission reduction. They believe that
reducing the amount of carbon dioxide produced will stem the greenhouse
effect and save humanity.
</p>
<p>
They have held international conferences that have resulted in global
accords like the Montreal Protocol&mdash;which banned
chlorofluorocarbons&mdash;and the Kyoto Protocol&mdash;which seeks a hefty
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the economic superpowers. Debate
is squelched by cries of impending doom and universal consensus. "We must
act now before it is too late," they clamor. Or they say, "No one
questions the validity of global warming." A more careful investigation
reveals just how wrong they are.
</p>
<p>
Global warming predictions are based on global climate models that are run
on supercomputers. The advantage of computer modelling is that it allows a
climatologist to tweak variables and see possible outcomes. The
disadvantage of computer modelling is that it is far from clear whether a
simulation can ever take account of all of the variables that make up our
climate. In other words, the knowledge required to accurately portray the
global climate approaches omniscience. For example, no one can accurately
determine the effect of the earth's oceans and sea currents on the
climate. Nor can they accurately estimate the effect of clouds or
cataclysmic events like volcanic eruptions. The sun's role in the earth's
climate is largely mysterious. And these are just the natural influences.
Human influences, such as pollution and carbon dioxide production, have
been quantified, but their causative relationship with climate is
indeterminate. This is not to say that climate is unknowable, just
currently unknown.
</p>
<p>
Due to the presently impossible incorporation of these variables into a
computer model, researchers are left to guessing at impacts and
hypothesizing causal relationships. The models are so rough that they
entirely miss the effect of mountains<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a>
and they treat the climate of heavily-forested Oregon and the Nevada
desert the same.<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a> The output of the
models they build become foregone conclusions because they are built on
certain suppositions assumed by the author. Given that these models are
used to predict climate in the near-future (within the next hundred
years), they should be able to provide accurate predictors of the past.
However, they cannot. Projections by computer models show that there
should have been a 0.4&deg;C rise in temperature over the last twenty
years due to large increases in CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;">2</span>
and other greenhouse gases, but satellite measurements for the years
1978-97 show no temperature rise at all. In fact, no reliable global
temperature records show the rise predicted by the computer models.<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a>
Also, when supplied with the relevant variables for the Pleistocene era,
advanced computer models fail to predict glaciers.<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a>
As James Hansen (the NASA scientist who started the global warming debate
in 1988) said in the October 1998 issue of <cite>Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences</cite>, "the forcings that drove long-term climate
change are not known with an accuracy sufficient to define future climate
change."<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a>  With the current uncertainty
of weather forecasts of weeks into the future, it is sheer folly to
presume that we can understand (at present) weather patterns decades and
centuries from now.
</p>
<p>
Another problem the global warming advocates face is the troublesome
climate record. Satellite measuring only came into widespread use in 1978.
Ground-based temperature measurement extends back about one hundred years.
These ground-based readings show a global rise of 1&deg;F this century,
with a surge in the eighties. Satellite readings do not show this,
however. Which set of data should one believe? The ground-based
readings&mdash;though accurate&mdash;have been collected mostly in the
Northern Hemisphere around urban centers. They don't record ocean
temperatures&mdash;a particularly startling fact given that three-quarters
of the earth's surface is ocean&mdash;and urban centers are prone to the
heat-island effect. Satellite readings, on the other hand, are more
accurate and cover the entire earth. Unfortunately, as noted earlier, they
only date from the late 70s&mdash;too soon for real impact. With an
imperfect dataset it is difficult to make accurate assessments.
</p>
<p>
Finally, by being quick to blame man and specifically the "developed"
nations, global warming supporters cast a blind eye to other plausible
explanations for temperature fluctuations. Serious research is underway
into the strong correlation between the sun's 11-year sunspot cycle and
global temperature changes. When plotted side by side, the graphs for
temperature change and solar magnetic cycle appear very similar.<a href="#6" class="footnote">6</a>
In fact, the Maunder Minimum&mdash;a century-long period when the sun
"dropped to very low levels of magnetism."<a href="#7" class="footnote">7</a>
This Maunder Minimum occurred at the same time as the Little Ice Age.
While the causal relationship has not been established, it seems certain
that the sun must have considerable influence on the earth's climate.
</p>
<p>
Even if the global warming advocates were correct and the global
temperature was going to rise as much as their ever-revising-downward
temperature predictions indicate, there is much to lead one to doubt their
prophecies of global catastrophe. There are several scientists who believe
that rising levels of carbon dioxide would be beneficial to plant growth
and would herald an agricultural time of plenty.<a href="#8" class="footnote">8</a>
Also, a recent study indicates that "warming may actually increase the
volume of ice stored in the large Antarctic ice sheets."<a href="#9" class="footnote">9</a>
The melting of ice sheets due to warmer sea surface temperatures would
result in a net increase in ice accumulation due to increased
precipitation. Finally, S. Fred Singer states that "any future moderate
warming, from whatever cause, will slow down the ongoing sea-level rise,
rather than speed it up."<a href="#10" class="footnote">10</a> In short,
the dire predictions of the global warming proponents would not
necessarily be the end of the world&mdash;no pun intended&mdash;even if
they were true.

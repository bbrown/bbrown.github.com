<br /><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> unveiled <a href="http://local.google.com/">Google Local</a> today and it is everything I would have hoped it would be if I had remembered that they were exploring this space.<br /><br />It takes Google to the streets. You enter in a location (in city, ZIP code, or address form) and then a key word. The results are displayed in distance from that location and related web pages. The big thing for me is that you can get a map with all of the results on it.<br /><br />It's like <a href="http://www.dexonline.com/">DexOnline</a>, n&#xE9;e QwestDex, only better, cleaner, and faster.<br /><br /><br />

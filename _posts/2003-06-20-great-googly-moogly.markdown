<br />Okay, whether this <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/39/31331.html">leak</a> was intentional or not&#x2014;and I'm leaning towards intentional&#x2014;<a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/cgi-bin/pic.cgi?i=/archives/g5fullpage.gif&amp;p=powermacg5">these</a> <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/cgi-bin/pic.cgi?i=/archives/g5specs.jpg&amp;p=powermacg5">specs</a> are absolutely astounding. <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>, in keeping with its newfound Apple love, has an <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/06/20/1153254&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=137&amp;tid=174">interesting discussion</a> on the matter. Doesn't this seem right up the alley of someone who might also be interested in the Mac OS X version of Quark XPress that was just announced? Hmm...me wonders if XPress was delayed because it was subtly optimized for an Apple with a 64-bit chip?<br /><br />For those too lazy to click through, the specs basically say "You're so gonna want one." If you're interested in commenting, please choose a topic: "How Bill Can Convince His Wife That We Need One of These Oh So Badly" or "8GB of DDR RAM? I Thought We'd Never Need More Than 640k"<br /><br />[UPDATE: <a href="http://www.appleturns.com/">As the Apple Turns</a> has a <a href="http://www.appleturns.com/scene/?id=4027">great scene</a> about this leak. Oh and a <a href="http://www.appleturns.com/vevo/">hilarious poll</a> as well&#x2014;'Uncontrollably doing a little leaking of a more personal nature'. Indeed.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 2: One enterprising individual has already created a <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/g5specs">G5 Spec T-shirt</a> in a vain effort to capitalize on Apple's flub.]<br /><br /><br />

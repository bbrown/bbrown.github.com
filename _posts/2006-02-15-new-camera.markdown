<p>In other news, I received my brand new digital camera, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007KQWDC/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/">Casio Exilim EX-Z750</a>, and I couldn't be more excited. (Side note: what the hell is with that name? I am going to have to Google it whenever I need to refer to it. Geesh.) I ordered it based solely on <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/casio/exz750.htm">this exhaustive review</a>; I actually hadn't even seen one until it was already shipping. I love taking pictures and, to me, the most important thing about taking good pictures is having a camera handy. In that vein, the smaller the better.</p>
<p>Previously, I had the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000645C9/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/">Canon PowerShot S200</a> and I loved it. It was the smallest thing going at the time, but it's really aged since I bought it. The two batteries I had stopped holding a charge; it was far larger than my cell phone and thus cramped in my pockets; it lacked the sophistication of newer models; and the shutter speed was lethargic. I could start to take a picture of my daughters doing something and completely miss the action once the picture was actually taken. We bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009VSBE/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/">Fuji FinePix S-5000</a> for precisely this reason: it has a fast release and it feels solid. But it clearly isn't pocketable and so we often don't have a camera handy for life's special moments.</p>
<p>I'll give a better report after I've used it awhile, but I've already noticed some serious pluses. (I also ordered this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009VSBE/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/">super fast 1 GB SD card</a> for only $58.99, which seems like a great deal. Would have been better had I ordered before 1/30/2006 and gotten the $20 mail-in rebate. Darn.)</p>
<p>[UPDATE (2/16/2006): Oh yeah, I also found <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/06/casio-ex-z750">this review</a> helpful.]</p>
<p>[UPDATE (2/26/2006): Darn. Amazon's got it on sale for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007KQWDC/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/">$298.99</a>, a full $20 off what I paid. At the time, Amazon had a price of $349 so <a href="http://www.buydig.com/">BuyDig.com</a>'s $319 was a steal. Darn.]</p>

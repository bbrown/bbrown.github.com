<br />This <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0502piestewa02.html">madness</a> has got to stop. It was one thing to <a href="2003_04_27_diamonds.cfm#200230063">rename Squaw Peak</a>, but to name the Squaw Peak Parkway the Lori M. Piestewa Freeway is wrong-headed. As I said before, it should be named the Triple-P&#x2014;Piestewa Peak Parkway&#x2014;because the highway is named for the mountain it wraps around.<br /><br />Piestewa Peak is annoying, but I guess it's got a lot of political currency. To honor a woman dead less than a month (maybe two) whose only accomplishment is being the first Indian woman killed in combat is ludicrous. The mountain and the freeway should have been renamed to honor Barry Goldwater, a true hero who accomplished so much for Arizona over his entire lifetime. Or even <a href="http://members.aol.com/Gibson0817/swilling.htm">Jack Swilling</a>, the Confederate entrepreneur whose Swilling Irrigation Company started the settlement of the Salt River Valley. You certainly don't see much around Phoenix honoring him.<br /><br />Of course, we shouldn't expect much from a town that gives all city workers a paid day off to honor Cesar Chavez, but not for <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/objectivism/columbus.html">Columbus</a>.<br /><br /><br />

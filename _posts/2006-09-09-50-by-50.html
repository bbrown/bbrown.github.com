I have really been remiss in setting goals for myself since my three lovely daughters arrived in my life. My wife just did <a href="http://www.fivebrowns.com/2006/09/50-by-50/">her 50 goals to accomplish by 50</a>, so I went ahead and figured out my 50. I once had a list a lot longer than this but it got lost in various Palm-related kerfluffles. I also realized through this exercise that I have a lot of goals that I couldn't imagine putting off till 50&#x2014;they were much more shorter-term. So I'm going to need to write up "in the next year" and "in the next five years" lists and I'll post them here if they're shareable.

Some of them are lofty and ambitious, but why set goals if they're easily attainable. Some of them also rely on a my children's desire to do those things and I will only work on those goals if they are willing and interested in them as well&#x2014;I'm not in the practice of forcing anything on anyone.

<a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">Go Daddy</a> is regularly lambasted for its advertisements, which often feature <a href="http://www.candicemichelle.com/">Candice Michelle</a>, the Go Daddy Girl, provocatively dancing. And by "provocatively" I mean sexually. Belly dancing is provocative, the tango is provocative, what's she's doing is stripping without the stripping. There are <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/index.php?serendipity%5Baction%5D=search&amp;serendipity%5BsearchTerm%5D=offensive">countless </a> <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/index.php?serendipity%5Baction%5D=search&amp;serendipity%5BsearchTerm%5D=sexist">examples</a> in <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/">Bob's blog</a> of people asserting that the ads are offensive. One of my co-workers <a href="http://www.danesparza.us/2007/02/05/why-i-like-the-breakfast-club/">wonders</a> whether we will ever "get beyond the cheap and tawdry."
</p>
<p>
It's a fair question because much of our advertising has focused on the Go Daddy Girls and there is no sign of a let up. But I think my co-worker and his ilk really miss the boat in their analyses.
</p>
<p>
Sex sells&#x2014;that is a fact born out by fifty years or more of advertising. People like to be titillated and they buy things from companies that do that. I think that the examples of pornography throughout human history bear witness to the fact that sex is (and always has been) a part of our lives. I think all of Go Daddy's detractors realize this and wouldn't dispute the ads' effectiveness; they just wish that it weren't so.
</p>
<p>
But how are their wishes going to change human nature? Sex is, at root, necessary for our survival but, more importantly, it's necessary for our personal survival. Sex is wonderful: there's a reason why people respond so well to images of it. Only those who have been led to believe that sex is dirty or wrong despise portrayals of it. It's a shame, really.
</p>
<p>
(Note that I am not here speaking of indiscriminate sex. The kind of person who'd have sex with anything that moves doesn't like himself. I am talking about sex coupled to love. That doesn't have to be between a husband and wife, just between two people in love.)
</p>
<p>
So the people who lament our commercials pine for a unsexual "witty" commercial. I share their enthusiasm for such commercials because they're invariably the most memorable. Think back to all the ads from the past that you can remember. How many of them had a scantily-clad woman writhing around? How many of them made you laugh out loud? I would bet that nearly all of them were the latter&#x2014;my favorites sure were.

<br /><a href="http://www.csun.edu/~dgw61315/thetwothings.html">Two things</a>: this has been making the rounds, but it didn't really fit the profile over at <a href="/blogs/found/">Found on the Web</a> so I'll post it here.<br /><br />I don't agree with the premise, but I do think that the exercise is useful at getting one to think in essentials. After all, can you think of any field in which there are only two things you <strong>really</strong> need to know and the rest are just details? If only knowledge were that simple.<br /><br /><br />

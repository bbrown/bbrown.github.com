<br />Today I went to the annual VNSA book sale. I normally avoid the Saturday craziness in favor of Sunday's more relaxed atmosphere and half-off pricing plan. If you've never been, you absolutely must go sometime. There's tens of thousands of books in a large hall, all relatively well-organized and accessible. I usually get quite a few good finds, even on Sunday. Of course, the best stuff usually gets purchased on Saturday but those people get there at 5 a.m. and wait in line for several hours for that. I did it once, but didn't particularly enjoy it.<br /><br />Here are the fifty books that I bought, in no particular order:<br /><ul><br /><li><cite>The Practice of Management</cite> by Peter F. Drucker</li><br /><li><cite>Give War a Chance</cite> by P.J. O'Rourke</li><br /><li><cite>The Essentials of C Programming Language</cite> by Ernest Ackermann</li><br /><li><cite>Bloom County: Loose Tails</cite> by Berke Breathed</li><br /><li><cite>Thinking in Java</cite> by Bruce Eckel</li><br /><li><cite>All the Trouble in the World</cite> by P.J.

I know that I've become more interested in all three lately&#x2014;the results of which you, fair reader, will see one of these days.<br /><br /><br />

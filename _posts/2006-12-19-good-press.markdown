This <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/12/18/magazines/business2/godaddy.biz2/">article about Bob Parsons</a> in <cite>Business 2.0</cite> is fascinating. From mention of his Jeep Rubicon that he calls Mad Max&#x2014;I can't believe I haven't seen it in the parking lot, got to look for it now&#x2014;to the statement from 1&amp;1's CEO that he's afraid of Bob&#x2014;that explains their advertisements&#x2014;to the elephant he bagged on his safari, this is the kind of press you just can't buy. It's certainly better than some of the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=go%20daddy">other news out there</a>.

<br />You've probably seen all of the <a href="http://www.cif.rochester.edu/~hathaway/switch/">Switch ad parodies</a> in the past. Apple has a new ad series about the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPods</a>. Astute readers will see immediately where I'm going with this.<br /><br />There's some new <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=1675">parodies</a> of that particular campaign. Hilarious!<br /><br /><br />

<br />In a <a href="http://grumet.net/weblog/archives/000118.html">comment</a> on <a href="http://grumet.net/weblog/">Andrew Grumet's blog</a>, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> announces that he's going to build a new RSS validator that will be open source and outside the control of <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a>. That's a pretty significant thing to announce in a comment on someone else's blog.<br /><br />Oh, and Dave also decided that I'm a real person. Apparently, someone must have thought that I was an elaborate alter ego of Mark's&#x2014;elaborate because he went to the trouble of creating a <a href="/aboutme/">huge</a> <a href="/values/">backstory</a>, nearly a year of <a href="/blogs/bblog/diamonds.cfm">bblog archives</a>, and almost a decade of <a href="/writings/">writings</a>. Seriously, I'm not making this up.<br /><br />[UPDATE: This will be my final blog entry about the Mark Pilgrim v. Dave Winer fracas. I'm sure this subject is of interest to maybe <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic">one regular reader</a>. It's helped my traffic see a small spike, but it was nothing compared to the <a href="2003_06_08_diamonds.cfm#200418763">time</a> I got that story posted on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 2: It's funny. Just a few days prior to this whole brouhaha I decided to start following the blogosphere more closely through <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>&#x2014;expanding my subscriptions from 96 to 127&#x2014;and I get embroiled in this whole thing. Quite the coincidence.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 3 (7/15/03): After <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/07/14#When:8:59:27PM">completely</a> <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/07/14#l08a5766959d139341772b0cbc0134695">melting</a> <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/07/14#When:8:24:30PM">down</a>, Dave <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2108">prevailed</a>. <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org/">Mark</a> has shuttered his Winer Watcher app and taken away a very useful utility&#x2014;as was his right, of course. The controversy is not forgotten, though, and I think Dave's credibility is pretty much shot through.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 4 (7/18/03): Mark has unveiled a <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/18/dive_into_accountability.html">revision system</a> on his own blog. Very cool and proves that he's willing to stand up to scrutiny. Also, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave</a>'s <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/2003/07/18#a24">formed</a> an "independent" advisory board consisting of him, a former UserLand employee who makes NetNewsWire, and a columnist who highlights Dave's achievements at every opportunity. Uh huh.]<br /><br /><br />

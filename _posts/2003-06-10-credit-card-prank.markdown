<br />The folks&#x2014;err, folk? I can't really tell&#x2014;at <a href="http://www.zug.com/">Zug.com</a> prove in a recent <a href="http://www.zug.com/pranks/credit/">prank</a> that signature lines on credit cards are virtually useless as security devices. Okay, okay, so it's not a controversial position but the way they proved it makes for a good read.<br /><br />While you're there, check out some other pranks like the <a href="http://www.zug.com/pranks/printer/">Printer Pranks series</a>, the <a href="http://www.zug.com/pranks/fooltool/">Prank Software</a>, <a href="http://www.zug.com/pranks/ideas/office.html" title="I love the paperclip photocopy idea.">Good Office Pranks</a>, and the <a href="http://www.zug.com/pranks/ideas/computer.html" title="I've implemented the PJL ready message change suggestion already. PC LOAD LETTER">Good Computer Pranks</a>.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to have to keep an eye on that site!<br /><br /><br />

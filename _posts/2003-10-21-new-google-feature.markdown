<br />Sweet. <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> has added a new feature to its main search interface. Entering <code>define</code> before your search term will conduct your normal search as well as provide a definition of the term or terms. The function appears to be relying heavily on Princeton's <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</a> software, which is quite an adequate base from which to work. It would be really neat if Google worked on WordNet and integrated its enhancements back in.<br /><br />Examples: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define+pakistan">define Pakistan</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define+google">define Google</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define+dave" title="Sure to piss off Dave Winer!">define Dave</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define+42">define 42</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define+rss" title="Something else that will piss off Dave">define RSS</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define+radio">define Radio</a>&#x2014;more evidence that Google is blacklisting Dave's products: they didn't even mention his software!!!, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define+apple">define apple</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define+fuck">define f*ck</a><br /><br /><br />

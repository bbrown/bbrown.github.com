<br />If you're reading this, then your ISP has already received the new DNS instructions for <a href="http://www.uplinkearth.com/vhaCoupon.cfm?kbid=1358">UplinkEarth</a>. It's been a pretty smooth move and the support folks at UplinkEarth are absolutely incredible. Their responsiveness is exemplary; they're everything I would want in a host&#x2014;well, I wish SQL Server wasn't $15 extra per month.<br /><br />I'm still using Blogger to manage my blogs because I can't find a good CFMX-based blogging engine that doesn't require &lt;cffile&gt; and I can't find a good ASP.NET application that supports MySQL. I toyed with writing my own, but that would just mean that it would never get done. So, I'm looking at <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/">Movable Type</a> since it's a packaged solution and it seems to have a lot of the features I desire. I'm also evaluating <a href="http://farcry.daemon.com.au/">FarCry</a> as a sitewide content management system. Either way, it's going to give me a lot of bang for no bucks.<br /><br /><br />

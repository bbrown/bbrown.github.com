<p>When I said that <a href="http://bbrown.info/2007/11/25/poof-goes-the-ads.aspx">agents are the future</a>, I might have given the impression that I thought it was going to be a slam dunk. There's a slew of problems associated with them that are going to be difficult to overcome.</p><ol><li>The consumers who would most benefit from agents are likely to not have time to set them up.</li><li>Agents tend to be defined to address specific industries, services, or needs. Deviation from the predefined logic is very limited.</li><li>Those providing the product or service generally prohibit third-party scraping of their content or lack the vision necessary to provide their own agents.</li><li>People are generally wont to give up the kind of valuable information necessary to provide robust details to an agent.</li></ol><p></p>

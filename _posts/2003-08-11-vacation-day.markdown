<br />Today I am taking a day off work to help <a href="/values/people/sandibrown.cfm">my teacher wife</a> set up her room for the new school year. It's something I do every year and it pretty much takes up the whole day. In other words, expect no blogging and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />If you absolutely need to read something, I've posted some new <a href="/writings/essays.cfm">essays</a>&#x2014;one on <a href="/writings/html/indiansinthepress.cfm">Indians in the press</a> and the other on <a href="/writings/html/jfk.cfm"><cite>JFK</cite> the movie</a>&#x2014;and <a href="reviews.cfm">reviews</a>&#x2014;three books: one by <a href="/writings/html/cruikshank.cfm">Cruikshank</a>, one by <a href="/writings/html/javabooks.cfm">Barker</a>  (this one appeared in <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/30/1751243&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=108&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=156">Slashdot</a>), and one by <a href="/writings/html/deloria.cfm">Deloria</a>. Or, oh what the hell, here's a link to an interesting article on <a href="http://www.scotlandsoftware.com/articles/programming/">programming</a> that I'm winding my way through. Enjoy!<br /><br />[NOTE: The reviews and essays are ones that I did for school so they're fairly academic. I've got a bunch more that I am slowly putting up,  but it's tedious because I want clean markup. Gots to have the clean markup.]<br /><br /><br />

<p>I'll admit that I only bought this soda because I liked saying "Pangleheimer's." I still do. I'm not really sure what a blush is but this sort of tastes like a wine cooler&#x2014;at least what I remember a wine cooler to taste like as I haven't had one since I snuck them in the late 80s. It tastes very unique and I like it on some levels: no aftertaste, a hard initial impression, and a slight fruitiness. I just can't see myself buying it again unless I wanted to say "Pangleheimer's."

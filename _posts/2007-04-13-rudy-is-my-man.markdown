Reading over <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/013/482uqcqf.asp">this informative article on Rudy Giuliani</a>, I am now more than ever certain that he's the best Republican candidate out there. I've been described as socially liberal and fiscally conservative too&#x2014;it's a close-enough description to my actual political views that I didn't correct the person&#x2014;and he was described similarly. Now I just need to figure out how to get involved.

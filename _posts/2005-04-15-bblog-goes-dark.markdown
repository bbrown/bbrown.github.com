<br />It's been nearly a month since my last post. I've started and stopped perhaps half a dozen entries and thought about posting at least a dozen more. I have a lot to say, but not the will to say it. I now understand what shutters so many bloggers out there.<br /><br />I've closed comments for all past entries and I'm going to keep them out there as a permanent archive. I'm still going to move this entire site over to <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/">TextPattern</a>; maybe I'll feel like blogging once that's done. At this point, I don't know.<br /><br />I guess I can't really say that I'm stopping blogging since <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/">Found on the Web</a> is going gangbuster and I'm keeping a respectable pace on <a href="http://www.fivebrowns.com/">Five Browns</a>. I've been working on a sekr1t project lately&#x2014;it's a non-profit that truly represents the culmination of my life to this point and I hope will be my life's legacy&#x2014;and I really need to devote whatever free time I would have spent blogging to it.<br /><br />I've had 880 entries on this blog, so I can't imagine that this is a permanent move. I appreciate everyone who has read my blog or commented&#x2014;it's been a fitful experience but I know I've grown as a person from it.<br /><br /><br />

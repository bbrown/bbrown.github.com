Despite one prominent politician's statements to the contrary, the era of
Big Government is not over. It is difficult in today's society to imagine
a limited government&mdash;the government is simply too pervasive. For
example, most people, especially businessmen, do not question the
government's involvement in prescribing an individual's wages or an
employer's hiring policies. They do not examine the rationale behind
antitrust laws or governmental micro-management of the workplace. They do
not question the right of the government to legislate special privileges
and exemptions for certain individuals and businesses.
</p>
<p>
These examples paint a picture of government usurpation of what have
traditionally been management prerogatives. Where once managers could
focus on effective business principles, now they must keep in mind the
countless edicts and regulations imposed by government. Where once
managers had the liberty to enact whatever policies they deemed necessary,
now they must wait for regulatory approval. Where once managers judged the
success of their management style by reduced costs and increased profit,
now their judgment is subject to the oversight of innumerable agencies of
government.
</p>
<p>
In spite of this, the United States' economy is booming. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average regularly reaches new pinnacles. America's world
economic preeminence is unchallenged. To the degree that other nations
emulate us is the degree to which their economies prosper. The Gross
National Product is growing, albeit moderately. By all measures, the
average standard of living is rising. Even amid such affluence, there
exists a feeling of malaise and uncertainty. People constantly question
the ability of the Dow Jones to continue its climb and they worry about
how long the boom will last. They complain about the increasing portion of
America's economy devoted to service. Investors hang on every word Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan utters.
</p>
<p>
On the face of it, these three situations&mdash;government
micro-management, booming economy, and uncertainty about the
future&mdash;seem contradictory. Common sense would dictate that
government meddling should drag the economy down and that a booming
economy should make people jubilant. Since this is not the case, we must
look deeper to find meaning. In order to resolve the businessman's plight
and to understand this perplexing situation, we must look to history.
</p>
<p>
It is useful to contemplate present problems through a consultation of
history&mdash;by which I mean the recording of the past. We find that our
forerunners experienced the same sort of situations. By evaluating their
resolutions, we can forego making the same mistakes and possibly improve
on their solution. American history is replete with periods of increasing
government regulation and booming economic growth. The post-World War II
era is one good example, but it lacks the historical perspective necessary
for an objective analysis.
</p>
<p>
We need look no further than the post-Civil War era. The two major
milestones marking the beginning of economic interventionism&mdash;<em>viz.</em>,
the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and the Interstate Commerce Commission
in 1887&mdash;were in effect. Except for some minor recessions in 1893 and
1907, this was a period of sustained industrial growth. It was also the
so-called Gilded Age&mdash;a time when the great industrialists roamed the
boardrooms and headquarters of America.
</p>
<p>
Thus, in this paper, I shall examine the effects of government
intervention in the economy on the businessmen of this period. In order to
delimit the fantastic breadth of this subject, I will focus on the biggest
concerns of the time and, more specifically, the entrepreneurs who founded
and ran them. The actors are the heavyweights of American industrial
history: James J. Hill, John D. Rockefeller Sr., and Charles Schwab. Since
many of these businessmen lived through successive waves of government
regulation, I will examine both their rise in a system of
near-laissez-faire and their fall in a less free economy.
</p>
<p>
Before we begin an exploration of governmental intervention, we must
understand the business environment in which government intervention was
undertaken. While commerce was dominated by the many legitimate
businessmen&mdash;men of integrity like Hill, Schwab, or
Rockefeller&mdash;there were plenty of scoundrels; men like Jay Gould,
Leland Stanford, and James Fisk obtained land grants, government loans,
and right-of-ways through influence-peddling. These 'political
entrepreneurs,'<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a> as historian Burton
Folsom calls them, flourished not by reducing costs or meeting customer's
needs, but through political dealing and unscrupulous stock manipulation.
They stifled competition by using various legislatures to put obstacles in
the path of their competitors or would-be competitors. They owed their
wealth to government handouts rather than productive ability.
</p>
<p>
During the period in question, there were several ways in which the
government affected business. A legislature could subsidize one company
with grants or loans. Or: the government could dictate the price at which
two parties may transact. Or: it could outlaw combinations of several
interests. In other words, government intervention was not always direct
and took on many different forms. The rationale behind such government
intervention generally fell into one of two categories: promotion of the
economy and punishment of unscrupulousness.
</p>
<p>
By far the most prevalent form of government meddling was assistance to
fledgling or foundering enterprises in the form of grants, loans, or
subsidies. The most infamous recipients of federal aid were the railroads.
That is, except for James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway. The Great
Northern was the only transcontinental railroad that never accepted
federal assistance and never went bankrupt. It was the least corrupt, best
built, and most popular of the transcontinentals. In marked contrast to
Hill, the other early railroad builders were not so restrained by
integrity. They accepted money from any legislature that would give it,
whether state, federal, or both. If a legislature showed any hesitancy
about doling out taxpayer money, they bribed, wined and dined, or
threatened as many representatives as necessary. They did not develop a
region before moving into it, as Hill did. They built tracks as quickly as
possible, cutting as many corners as they could, and limited the number of
spurs off the main track (since they received no additional money for
building them). As the indefatigable Cornelius Vanderbilt said: "Building
railroads from nowhere to nowhere at public expense is not a legitimate
business."<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a>
</p>
<p>
It all began in 1862, when Congress passed the Pacific Railroad Act. This
Act gave the Union Pacific, building from Nebraska to Utah, and the
Central Pacific, building from California to Utah, ten alternate sections
of land per mile completed.<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a> In
addition to these land grants, the roads were to get loans in the amount
of $16,000 for each mile of plains trackage, $48,000 per mile for
mountainous areas, and $32,000 a mile for inter-mountain building.<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a>
In 1864, a second act was passed doubling the roads' land grants and
lowering the government's mortgage from first to second position.<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a>
Since the Union Pacific covered eight thousand miles of track and the
Central Pacific nearly as much, the money and land was significant. In the
end, the Union Pacific had the benefit of $27 million in thirty-year,
six-percent government bonds  and 12 million acres of land. The Central
Pacific garnered $24 million in government bonds and 9 million acres of
land.<a href="#6" class="footnote">6</a>
</p>
<p>
The other chartered transcontinental&mdash;the Northern
Pacific&mdash;received twenty sections per mile of trackage in the states
and forty sections in the territories.<a href="#7" class="footnote">7</a>
It was originally organized by the Civil War bond promoter Jay Cooke, but
it soon failed and brought the Panic of 1873 on with it. Henry Villard, a
German of considerable charisma, picked up where Cooke left off. Like the
Union and Central Pacific, Villard laid his tracks in a straight line as
quickly as possible, in order to obtain the land grants. In 1883, the
Northern Pacific was near bankruptcy and he was relieved of his duties.
</p>
<p>
The subsidies aimed at expanding the economy. They actually only succeeded
in expanding the wealth of the &eacute;lite few on the receiving end of
government largess. And it was rarely the most productive or most able who
got the assistance; it tended to be those businessmen with the best
"Washington men" or the most lavish gifts to Congressmen. In other words,
the recipients were what philosopher Ayn Rand called "the aristocracy of
pull."<a href="#8" class="footnote">8</a> Since they lacked an interest
in the success or productivity of their various enterprises, the
pull-peddlers spent their aid on boondoggles and lavish mansions.<a href="#9" class="footnote">9</a>
And, because they could always appeal to the government for more money if
they failed, there was no incentive to succeed.
</p>
<p>
The remaining previously mentioned measures were intended to right wrongs
committed by the pull-peddlers. For example, when the Central Pacific and
other transcontinentals began charging exorbitant rates because they held
a legally-enforced monopoly, farmers and other freight-producers
complained to their representatives. Eventually, the Interstate Commerce
Commission was created. Or: when increasing numbers of enterprises
combined into larger conglomerates, trying to pool resources and control
prices, the newspapers bellowed charges of monopoly and encouraged people
to complain to their congressmen. The result was the Sherman and Clayton
Antitrust Acts.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, the clamor for rate controls resulted in the ICC. In 1874,
Jay Gould took charge of the ailing Union Pacific. At that time, the
Thurman Law&mdash;which forced the railroad to pay 25% of gross revenues
to the government in order to retire some of its debt&mdash;had just been
passed. Of course, lopping off a quarter of revenue had considerable
effects which had to be counteracted. So, Gould doubled the rates and,
shortly thereafter, raised them another twenty to thirty-three
percent&mdash;enabling him to pay off some debt and declare a small
dividend. The results of such practices were predictable. In 1887, the
Interstate Commerce Commission was created. It quickly moved to end the
Union Pacific's high rates. This shut down the Union Pacific's last-ditch
options and it declared bankruptcy in 1893.
</p>
<p>
The Interstate Commerce Commission was a reaction to the inefficiencies of
a subsidized road. The Commission, however, had to apply its edicts and
regulations uniformly. This meant that James J. Hill's Great Northern was
subject as well. In 1900, Hill had established the Great Northern
Steamship Company. This subsidiary was to carry passengers and freight
from the Great Northern's Western terminus of Seattle to the Far East.
With the great cost-cutting he had achieved, he could ship wheat from
Minnesota to Seattle, for transport by steamship to Japan, and still price
it competitively. Trade with the Far East to that time was underdeveloped
and Hill saw in his steamship company great promise. He envisioned
replacing rice as the staple of the Japanese diet with Minnesota wheat.<a href="#10" class="footnote">10</a>
"If the people of a single province of China should consume [instead of
rice] an ounce a day of our flour," Hill envisioned, "they would need
50,000,000 bushels of wheat per annum, or twice the Western surplus."<a href="#11" class="footnote">11</a>
The Hepburn Act, passed in 1906, prohibited rate discrimination. That
meant that Hill had to charge the same shipping rate for travel within
Minnesota as he did for travel from St. Paul to Japan. He could either
give every shipper the same discount he gave to Oriental trade or he
could, and did, give the Oriental trade the same rate as he charged
everyone else. The immediate effect was the halving of Oriental-American
trade. All told, the Hepburn Act and the ICC forced Hill to sell his
steamships, discontinue his foreign trade, and end discounts for
long-distance shipping.
</p>
<p>
By far the most common practice of government punishment was antitrust
enforcement. The most significant instance of 'trust-busting' was James J.
Hill's Northern Securities. A trust is a legal invention that corresponds
with our modern notion of a holding company. Simply put, corporations give
their stock to the trustees for holding. The trustees then issue shares of
the trust to the owners of the assimilated corporations. It was a very
efficient way of exercising centralized control over a disparate
amalgamation, while retaining corporate identities and operational
practices.
</p>
<p>
Hill's trust, in <cite>Northern Securities v. U.S.</cite>, was the first
major target of the antitrust legislation. After the Union Pacific went
bankrupt in 1893, E.H. Harriman purchased it for a song. He learned from
the mistakes of Gould and the lessons of Hill. He then set his sights on
buying the Northern Pacific, which had been bought by Hill and had
recently acquired the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy&mdash;a highly
profitable and well-built road that ran parallel to the Union Pacific.
Harriman found the thought of a Hill-controlled direct competitor
distasteful and set about surreptitiously purchasing Northern Pacific
stock. Hill saw the fluctuations in price and heavy traffic of NP stock
and concluded that something was on the horizon. With the assistance of
financier J.P. Morgan, he created a trust called Northern Securities.<a href="#12" class="footnote">12</a>
This way, anyone trying to purchase control of the CB&amp;Q would have to
buy out Northern Securities, capitalized at $400 million.<a href="#13" class="footnote">13</a>
</p>
<p>
Theodore Roosevelt, the legendary 'trust-buster,' targeted Northern
Securities in 1902. After two years of costly litigation, the Supreme
Court reached its decision. Chief Justice John Marshall Harlan, writing
for the 5-4 majority opinion, stated, "The act is not limited to
restraints of interstate and international trade or commerce that are
unreasonable in their nature, but embraces <em>all</em> direct
<em>restraints.</em>"<a href="#14" class="footnote">14</a> Previously,
antitrust had been interpreted to apply only to so-called 'unreasonable'
restraint of trade. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, in his Supreme Court
debut, wrote the dissenting opinion. In it, he wrote these now-famous
words: "Great cases like hard cases make bad law." Hill vehemently
disagreed with the court's ruling, but complied with the decision and
broke up Northern Securities.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the circumstances, the end result was that the good
industrialists&mdash;the ones who succeeded through hard work and
integrity&mdash;were lumped with the dishonest. The laws and regulations
designed to avert venal practices were applied equally to both groups.
While the ruthless sector simply found a new scheme to bilk the Treasury,
the productive sector languished. At the very least, the press and the
populace linked these two groups together. There were, however,
considerable differences.
</p>
<p>
All the great industrialists previously mentioned shared an uncommon
attention to details and efficiency. James J. Hill, for example, standing
on a Dakota siding, spotted an engine numbered 94. From that casual
spotting, he walked up the engineer and addressed him by name, further
noting that that particular engine had just been in for repairs.<a href="#15" class="footnote">15</a>
During the depression of 1893, Hill sent this directive: "Take whatever
steps are necessary to reduce track, machinery, stations, and other
service to the lowest point possible. Take off all extra gangs everywhere,
except those relaying steel. Reduce wages section foremen to forty dollars
[a month] east and forty-five west, and of section men to one dollar [a
day] east and one dollar and a quarter west &hellip;."<a href="#16" class="footnote">16</a>
As Hill said, "A railroad is successful in the proportion that its affairs
are vigilantly looked after."<a href="#17" class="footnote">17</a> Hill
built his railroad at the lowest grade, using the best available steel. He
understood that money spent now repaid itself many times over. As the
previous quotations indicate, the Great Northern was certainly vigilantly
looked after.
</p>
<p>
Another key aspect of long-range thinking was taking risks whose long-term
prospects were good, but entailed short-term risk. For example, Charles
Schwab learned of Rockefeller's knack for spotting diamonds in the rough
when Rockefeller spent almost $40 million in the Mesabi iron range near
Lake Superior. Schwab recalled, "Our experts in the Carnegie Company did
not believe in the Mesabi ore fields. They thought the ore was poor &hellip;.
They ridiculed Rockefeller's investments in the Mesabi." By 1901, however,
U.S. Steel purchased Rockefeller's Mesabi investments for $90 million.<a href="#18" class="footnote">18</a>
Similarly, Hill's plan to build a transcontinental railroad north of the
Northern Pacific was dubbed "Hill's Folly" by his detractors. The
foresight in each instance is uncommon.
</p>
<p>
The economic dislocations and unintended consequences of government
intervention in the economy were rather obvious in the post-Civil War era.
That is because economic regulation was predominantly rare. Today,
however, every facet of economic life is prescribed and dictated. Think of
the dislocations and unintended consequences that occur under such a
system. For example, the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act
was supposed to guarantee equal access for the handicapped. Instead, it
imposed severe economic repercussions on the businesses affected by it.
Congress had not intended to produce the economic consequences&mdash;one
would hope&mdash;but they occurred nonetheless. Similarly, the Federal
Reserve system was intended to stabilize the banking industry when it was
originally conceived and implemented. Today, it is primarily a means of
creating money for the government out of thin air, <em>i.e.</em>,
inflation. It also destabilizes the banking system by allowing the banks
to rely on its money reserves in crunch times. These, however, are
subjects which necessitate whole books. The point is that the impact of
economic regulation is difficult to judge and, to the policy, detrimental.
</p>
<p>
If the regulations are pernicious enough, the people will lose faith in
the economic system. When this happens, malaise ensues. Although the
economy is thriving, people feel like it rests on sand. During the
post-Civil War era, this precise thing happened. Shortly after the passage
of both the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Interstate Commerce Commission,
there came about a depression unparalleled in American history. It lasted
only four years (1893-7), but was followed less than ten years later by
another panic-breeding recession. Today, we have a serious recession every
ten to fifteen years. It is endemic to a mixed economy that booms and
busts are cyclical.
</p>
<p>
The lesson is that governmental meddling creates unintended consequences
and unnecessary dislocation. It should be vigorously avoided. Furthermore,
their example counsels that prosperity is something which comes from
commerce and entrepreneurship, not government handouts or privilege. There
are two types of entrepreneurs: market and political.<a href="#19" class="footnote">19</a>
Finally, it implies that the freer the economy, the more self-correcting
it is. If there had not been governmental interference, James J. Hill
would have had an incentive to compete directly with the Union Pacific or
buy it outright&mdash;thus offering better service and better quality that
was preempted by regulation. All of these lessons emanate from the very
heart of our cultural heritage of rugged individualism and liberty. The
message is clear; it is up to us to learn from it.

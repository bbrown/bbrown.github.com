"Without a doubt, politicians and others continue to make principled noises on occasion—for the simple reason that the rhetoric of principle still sells. Sounding such themes is thought to be practical. Nine times out of ten, however, words of principle are hollow. These days, when you hear a principle articulated, it is advisable to stay tuned, for a contradiction is almost invariably in the neighborhood, whether explicitly or implicitly." – Tara Smith, <a href="https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2008-fall/menace-of-pragmatism.asp">"The Menace of Pragmatism"</a>

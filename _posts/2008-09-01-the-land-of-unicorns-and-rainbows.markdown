"This shit is too pedantic, too convoluted, and violates too many preconceived notions of how authentication works. Instead of trying to figure out your bullshit, a user will just use the same username and password that he uses for everything. Problem solved." &#x2014; Ted Dziuba, <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2008/09/openid-is-why-i-hate-the-inter.html">"OpenID is Why I Hate the Internet"</a>

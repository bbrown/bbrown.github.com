I saw <cite>The Dark Knight</cite> on Friday morning but I don't feel comfortable reviewing it just yet. I want to see it again just to make sure of a few salient points. I plan to see it again in a week or so at an IMAX theater to get the full experience. Until then, let me just say that I think it is the best Batman film ever. I loved <cite>Batman Begins</cite> and this one was much, much better.

Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was amazing. He played the nihilism perfectly. Michael Caine as Alfred describes him thus: "Some men just like to watch the world burn." Ledger makes you believe that that is his exact motivation. I think he really stole the show and would deserve any Oscar that he'll surely be nominated for&#x2014;even though the Academy would just do it because of his untimely death.

In the end, I highly recommend that you see this movie if you like Batman at all. It's audacious, visually stunning, and exceedingly well-acted. I'm seeing it twice and I can't remember the last movie I saw twice at the theaters.

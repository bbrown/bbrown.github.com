<br />As I hinted at in an earlier post, I've accepted a job at <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy.com</a> as a Senior .NET Engineer in the <a href="http://www.starfieldtech.com/">Starfield Technologies</a> division. I start on Tuesday, May 10th and I couldn't be more excited.<br /><br />Sandi has repeatedly told me that I shouldn't get my hopes too high, that every workplace has its flaws. But I just can't help it: it's a new environment and every day will be new&#x2014;as opposed to every day being more of the same. I don't know any of my colleagues at this point and I've searched around for any Go Daddy bloggers to little effect, so I can't really say that my anticipation has much foundation.<br /><br />Go Daddy has three great things going for it in my mind: its CEO <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/">Bob Parsons</a>, its longevity, and its rapid growth. With an inspiring leader at the helm, it's possible to feel like your employer has a vision and to develop a desire to help him reach it. When a company has been around for several years and is still growing at a phenomenal pace, there's ample opportunity for advancement and personal growth.<br /><br />On Tuesday, I'll inquire as to whether there's a blogging policy so that I might share future thoughts instead of maintaining the radio silence I've had for the last several years.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Here's the Go Daddy bloggers I've been able to find in my searches:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.marcgawith.modblog.com/">Marc Gawith ModBlog</a>, <a href="http://paul.hahn.name/">Paul Hahn</a>, <a href="http://www.geekrefuge.com/">Geek Refuge</a>, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/cterror/">My Journal or Something</a>, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/little_angel/">intraa dot net</a>, <a href="http://cliffud.com/">cliffud</a>, <a href="http://www.dylanbaxter.com/">Dylan Baxter</a>]<br /><br />[UPDATE (5/20/2005): Found another one: <a href="http://hohle.net/">Hohle.net</a>.]<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

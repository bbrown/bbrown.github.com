<br />I thought that I had already posted an entry about <a href="http://whynot.net/">WhyNot</a> and its accompanying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591391539/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link">book</a>, but I can't find it after looking through the archives. Damn! It's a really cool site and the book sounds intriguing.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.startupgarden.com/">Tom Ehrenfeld</a>, whose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071368248/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link">book</a> I have mentioned, just <a href="http://www.startupgarden.com/mt/archives/000035.html">reviewed</a> the book in his blog. He recommends the book highly, stating that it stands out in the crowd of books about innovation. Good enough for me; added to my Wish List.<br /><br />I'm an innovation and creativity junkie, reading just about anything on the subject. I like to think of myself as a creative type, but I know my limitations. I'm always sure that I'm missing something and that that something is out there for me to find and discover. I read <a href="http://www.corante.com/ideaflow/">IdeaFlow</a> regularly, looked into <a href="http://www.triz-journal.com/">TRIZ</a>, and contemplated <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20030925.html">Taguchi</a>.<br /><br />I might be kidding myself, thinking that I'm worse off creatively than I really am. But I usually garner at least a morsel of useful information from the books I read and the sites I browse, so I guess it's not a complete waste of time.<br /><br /><br />

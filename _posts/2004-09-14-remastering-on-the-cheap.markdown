<br /><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5580">Using iTunes as an Audio Processor</a>: I've got a lot of records and tapes that I want to convert to a digital format but it's such a chore to edit out noise, cracks, and hiss from the waveform. By "such a chore" I mean that I would rather eat spackle. I did it when I recorded all of Sandi's childhood albums onto CD, but I did that for love. Ease of listening and portability aren't love, let me tell you.<br /><br /><br />

<br />Another awesome entry from <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/">Eric Sink</a> today: this one's on what he terms <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/Career_Calculus.html">career calculus</a>. It suggests that you should focus on the things you can affect in furthering your career.<br /><br />In his view, the only thing you can change is learning. By focusing on continuous learning&#x2014;or that annoying buzzword "lifelong learning"&#x2014;you can soar ahead of your peers, who are presumably sitting on their hands doing diddly-squat. (I would inject some poignant examples at this point, except that I suspect my co-workers might read them.)<br /><br />He's definitely correct in his conclusions and evaluations, but isn't this common knowledge? Isn't knowledge power? Perhaps I'm being na&#xEF;ve, but I thought this was the way to get ahead. I had a period where I was very stagnant in my learning, but that's long past&#x2014;thankfully.<br /><br />For me, Eric's article is a reminder to never dawdle or tread water. Keep on swimming, Bill! The future is yours.<br /><br /><br />

<p>
My ambivalence towards John McCain as president is <a href="/2008/02/07/presidential-complications.aspx">well-documented</a>. But a thought just hit me that makes me think his presidency might be a net good (but barely): he's opposed by the religious right. As <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006649">many</a> <a href="http://www.liberalslikechrist.org/about/Goldwater.html">have</a> <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?id=17465">noted</a>, the religious right's rise in importance within the Republican Party is worrying and could have positively dreadful effects in the long-term. Anything that serves to limit their influence is promising, no matter how otherwise unpalatable it might be. If he would host Giuliani as his vice-president, then I'll be more optimistic about the return of the GOP to its Goldwater days than I've ever been in my life.

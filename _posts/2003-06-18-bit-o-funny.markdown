<br />Two funny things I found on the Web in the course of my surfing:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.bigthings.ca/">Big Things in Canada</a>: an online catalog of big, gaudy monuments in the land of Canuck. For example, the <a href="http://www.bigthings.ca/bc/cache.html">gold miner</a>, the <a href="http://www.bigthings.ca/alberta/glendon.html">pierogie</a>, and the <a href="http://www.bigthings.ca/manitoba/gladstone.html">happy rock</a>. Yeah, I don't know what it's aboot either.</li><li><a href="http://www.trailerghost.com/ghost/">Haunted Mobile Homes</a>: The <a href="http://www.trailerghost.com/ghost/facts.htm">facts page</a> reveals that ghosts are the second biggest threat facing trailer park dwellers, after tornados and before cops. I'm pretty sure this is tongue-in-cheek.</li></ul><br /><br /><br />

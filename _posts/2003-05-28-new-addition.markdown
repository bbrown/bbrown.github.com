<br />I just added a page to hold some <a href="http://www.bbrown.info/lists/">lists</a>. The current lists available deal with recent movies I've seen, books I've read, and books I'm reading. Eventually, I'll add funny lists but I doubt that it'll be as impressive as <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/lists/">McSweeney's</a> or <a href="http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/top_ten/">David Letterman's</a> but I'll do what I can.<br /><br />[NOTE: I'm sure that I've forgotten some books and movies, but I make no pretense at it being accurate historically.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />There's a <a href="http://us.a1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/a/he/hewlett_packard/wheresmygnome728x90.gif">strange ad</a> on Yahoo! lately indicating someone named Bill's displeasure at the loss of his lawn gnome and an <a href="http://www.whereismygnome.com/">accompanying web site</a> that is painful in its forced amateurness. A quick check on <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/links.html?url=www.whereismygnome.com&amp;sub=Get+Link+Cosmos">Technorati</a> indicates that quite a few bloggers are wondering about its strange origins.<br /><br />However, the URL from the Yahoo! ad indicates that this is a campaign by Hewlett-Packard&#x2014;I thought they've gone to HP after the Carly Fiorina board fight&#x2014;so it is clearly an astroturf campaign designed to excite comment from bloggers. Hopefully, it'll fail miserably since it's so trite.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Oh and the 800 number is a dead giveaway that there's some deep pockets bankrolling this thing.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />A new Audi concept car was unveiled at the Frankfurt Auto Show in September: the <a href="http://www.germancarfans.com/news.cfm/newsid/2030908.006/audi/1.html">Audi Le Mans Quattro</a>. The <a href="http://www.germancarfans.com/photos.cfm/photoid/3030908.002/audi/1.html">pictures</a> are incredible, as are the amount and variety of smileys used in the <a href="http://germancarfans.zeroforum.com/zerothread?id=5054">discussion forum</a>. Finally, another article on the site examines the effort that went into <a href="http://www.germancarfans.com/news.cfm/newsid/2031119.002/audi/1.html">making this concept car</a> in eleven months.<br /><br />If you're thinking to yourself that it's a concept car that'll never see the light of day, remember that the <a href="/values/things/auditt.cfm">Audi TT</a> was once a concept car that was virtually unchanged when it went into production.<br /><br /><br />

<br />It's almost trite, but I've still got to do it. <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a>&#x2014;the social pundit with the funny name&#x2014;has a new column out entitled "<a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html">A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy</a>" that is over 10,000 words long. Umm, column? How about treatise? I'm on page six of a single-spaced, thirteen-page printout&#x2014;I would have been further along, but I was in an all-staff meeting and I had to look like I was participating at times&#x2014;but so far, it's a real page turner!<br /><br />The subject of his paper is how groups distort online communities towards particular ends over and over again. It's a great elaboration of some basic research and hovers around the same topic that Derek Powazek's great book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735710759/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Design for Communities</cite></a> covered. Shirky's focus, though, is on <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/">social software</a>, which he defines as "software that supports group interaction," instead of community Web sites. There's a lot of stuff there to ponder, and I'll probably write up my thoughts more completely once I've finished the paper.<br /><br />If you get through this paper, I would highly recommend catching up on some of his other essays like "<a href="http://shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html">Power Laws, Weblogs, and Inequality</a>" or "<a href="http://shirky.com/writings/half_the_world.html">Half the World</a>." If you like what you see, then subscribe to his <a href="mailto:nec-request@shirky.com?subject=subscribe">NEC newsletter</a> and get a regular Shirky fix.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I have had a busy week, as has most everyone I'm sure. You may be thinking that atheism and Christmas don't mix well, but they <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/medialink/commercialxmas.shtml" title="Ayn Rand also wrote a great article on the subject, but it's not available online.">do</a> when you're an <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/objectivism/">Objectivist</a>.<br /><br />So, anyhow, great Christmas. My wife got me an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a>, which is around $400 and well worth it. It's already liberated me from my laptop, which liberated me from my desktop. I don't know what could liberate me from my iPod, but I don't know that I want to be. In related computer news, I got a <a href="http://www.tibag.com/">TiBag</a>&#x2014;a messenger bag designed to hold <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">PowerBook G4s</a>. My wife thinks it looks <a href="http://members.aol.com/PjSilly10/notgay.wav">gay</a>, but she's never seen all of the messenger-bag-toting heterosexuals at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/">ASU</a> and she doesn't have to lug around a <a href="http://www.epinions.com/otdr-Backpacks-All-Jansport_Lap_Station_43076" title="Hides a laptop extraordinarily well. I paid $120 for mine nearly two years ago.">huge backpack</a>.<br /><br />I also got an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/kitchen/B00005B6ZC/">electric razor</a> that is very nice, ultra-convenient, and not as close as a razor. I don't care, though, because I absolutely hate shaving and this makes it quick. I'll shave twice as often to keep the facial hair off if it's this easy.<br /><br />I got a bunch of DVDs (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QW4K/" title="Official Bootleg Edition: Marketing Hype in Titles"><cite>Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005QCVV/" title="Some say I look like Steve Martin, a comparison I heartily endorse."><cite>L.A.

No Simpsons, but acceptable."><cite>SpongeBob SquarePants</cite></a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004RFFI/" title="Okay, I just like Helen Hunt."><cite>Twister</cite></a>) and books (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672323710/" title="I normally shun this series of books, but this one came highly recommended on several web design lists I'm on."><cite>Sams Teach Yourself Macromedia Flash MX in 24 Hours</cite></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1565794354/" title="Wonderful idea and beautiful execution.

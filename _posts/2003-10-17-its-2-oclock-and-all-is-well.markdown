<br />Phew, this every three to four hour feeding thing is weird. I think I understand why everyone always jokes about sleep deprivation with new kids. But you know, it's amazing and it's all worth it. Those of you with kids will understand ("Ahh, someone just got initiated into the Parenthood Club."); those of you without just can't.<br /><br />I always understood it on an intellectual level, but I never grokked it emotionally. People would always blather on about how it's the most wonderful thing ever. It is. It really, really is.<br /><br /><br />

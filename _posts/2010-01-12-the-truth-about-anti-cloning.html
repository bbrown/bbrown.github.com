<p>
When the news first swept the world about the cloning of a sheep, a wave
of science-fiction reading journalists postulated that soon we would be
cloning Michael Jordan in order to create a stellar basketball team.
Hysteria flourished in the halls of the federal government as members of
Congress and the President clamored to issue public denunciations of human
cloning. Once the initial hype died down and along with it outrageous
predictions, sober dialogue and debate about the ethical implications of
the new technology should have followed.
</p>
<p>
Instead, we were treated to an outpouring of hand-wringing and moral
condemnation. Pope John Paul II declared that every human has a "right to
a unique human genome." UNESCO has weighed in as well, declaring,
"Practices which are contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive
cloning of human beings, shall not be permitted."<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a>
Nineteen members of the European Council have signed an agreement
prohibiting the cloning of humans saying that "&hellip; it is important
for Europe solemnly to declare its determination to defend human dignity
against the abuses of scientific techniques."<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a>
Finally, our own President reminded us that "[i]t's good to remember that
scientific advancement does not occur in a moral vacuum."<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a>
</p>
<p>
These comments beg a great deal of questions. Is cloning immoral? By what
standard? Is the case against human cloning as airtight as the statements
indicate? Should cloning be banned for the public safety? In the
voluminous writing on the subject, the answers to these questions are far
from apparent. In this essay, I will briefly detail the scientific
background of cloning. Then I will attempt to flush the philosophical
underpinnings of the anti-cloning camp from the bushes of assertion.
Finally, I will examine these underlying premises' validity and
objectivity. Through these efforts, I hope to shine the illuminating light
of reason on an oftentimes emotional subject.
</p>p>
<p>
Before we move on to these premises, though, we must elaborate the context
of the cloning issue&mdash;that is, we must understand the scientific
theories behind cloning. The whole field of biotechnology is undergoing a
revolution. With the discovery of recombinant DNA in 1970, the
possibilities of manipulating biological entities seems endless. There now
exists a Human Genome Project charged with mapping the whole of man's
genetic structure. Once that is achieved, man's heretofore unknown
internal development will be laid bare.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, cloning is the hottest research going. It is currently
focused on a process known as 'somatic cell nuclear transfer.' In this
procedure, the nucleus of one cell is inserted into another cell whose
nucleus has been removed. As amazing as this is, still more incredible is
the potential for combining this nuclear transfer with recent
breakthroughs involving adult cells. Prior to becoming mature, adult
cells, cells are embryonic&mdash;retaining the potentiality of being any
type of cell once there is the proper stimulus. These cells are known as
stem cells. It now appears that adult cells can be 'reset' back to stem
cells and then&mdash;with the proper stimulus&mdash;any kind of cell
imaginable.
</p>
<p>
This is what the Roslin experiment indicated. In February 1997, Ian Wilmut
and his colleagues at the Scottish animal research facility successfully
cloned a sheep from an adult mammary cell. They did this by removing the
nucleus of an adult udder cell and then inserting it into a sheep egg cell
whose nucleus had been removed.<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a> Once
the cell began dividing, it was implanted into the uterus of another sheep
where it underwent the normal gestational process and entered the world as
a genetically-equivalent copy of its 'mother.' This newborn was called
Dolly and initiated a worldwide debate that continues to this day.
</p>
<p>
While questions still linger&mdash;namely about whether the donor nucleus
was in fact an adult cell<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a>&mdash;the
Dolly experiment did prove that somatic cell transfer does work.
Subsequent experiments in Oregon involving a Rhesus monkey confirmed
Wilmut's findings.<a href="#6" class="footnote">6</a> This technology is
not just of theoretical importance; the ability to change a cell into a
completely different type of cell has profound implications for current
disease treatment. Patients suffering from leukemia could be given healthy
marrow cells removed from their own bodies, thus solving the biggest
problem facing such patients&mdash;inability to find an acceptable donor.
Or diabetics could get insulin-producing cells transplanted into their
pancreas. Or heart attack victims could get heart tissue replacements. The
possibilities are both staggering and endless.
</p>
<p>
The real controversy does not lie with such inarguable medical benefits.
It centers around attempts or proposed attempts to duplicate the Dolly
experiment on human beings. The controversy has been stirred by the likes
of people such as Richard Seed. Seed broke some startling news at a
Chicago symposium on reproductive technologies in December of 1997.<a href="#7" class="footnote">7</a>
He claimed that he was going to establish a clinic for human cloning using
private funds and expects the demand to rise to about 200,000 per year
once his procedure is perfected.<a href="#8" class="footnote">8</a> He
further claims that he has already obtained some seed money (no pun
intended) as well as some doctors and donors who are willing to be the
first participants. This set off a public furor which resulted in a
general ban on cloning in Europe and a spate of bills in both houses of
Congress seeking everything from a five-year moratorium to outright
prohibition.<a href="#9" class="footnote">9</a>
</p>
<p>
What is the source of such disapproval? Why does cloning engender such
moral opprobrium? In my research on the subject, I have found that
arguments against human cloning have fallen into one of four general
themes: cloning is unnatural; cloning is a glaring example of man's
hubris; cloning has great potential for misuse; and cloning precludes
genetic diversity.
</p>
<p>
The artificiality of cloning is by far the most popular argument offered
against cloning. Cloning is just not the way human beings reproduce,
according to this view. Changing the way humans engage in one of the most
basic needs is fraught with possible peril. Like homosexuality, it is
flaunting the natural order of things. Columnist George Will put it this
way: "What if the great given&mdash;a human being is a product of the
union of a man and woman&mdash;is no longer a given?" Environmentalist
Jeremy Rifkin observed that cloning "throws every convention, every
historical tradition, up for grabs."<a href="#10" class="footnote">10</a>
</p>
<p>
Related to the unnatural argument is the fear that cloning would produce a
slew of genetically-identical people. In other words, cloning would reduce
the diversity of our population. Genetics plays a huge role in determining
our individuality and identity, proponents of this premise believe. Start
duplicating people and you become a homogenous, collectivist society. "Can
individuality, identity, and dignity be severed from genetic
distinctiveness, and from belief in a person's open future?" asks Will.<a href="#11" class="footnote">11</a>
The assumption underlying Will's query is that these human traits cannot
be separated from genetic foundations&mdash;that is, all of man's
identity, personality, intelligence, etc. are derived from genetic
factors. Professor John Fletcher of the University of Virginia's medical
school and an authority on biomedical ethics calls this belief 'genetic
essentialism' and says that polls indicate between thirty and forty
percent of Americans share Will's opinion.<a href="#12" class="footnote">12</a>
</p>
<p>
Another prominent argument by which cloning is deplored is the man-as-God
premise. This view basically states that creation is the exclusive domain
of God, or should be. For men to arrogate that fundamental divine power
for themselves is an unpardonable sin. Man should accept God's divine
wisdom and not try to second-judge His actions. By what right does mankind
meddle in the affairs of the supreme being? Who is man to believe himself
of such significance?
</p>
<p>
This argument also has its roots in the 'unnatural' argument since God
created the natural order of things. Any deviation from this norm is a
flaunting of God's natural edicts. Cloning, as the Pope has said, is
simply not how Christians reproduce. Or, more colloquially, if God had
meant for man to clone himself, He would have given him asexual
reproduction. Since He didn't, man must make do with the old-fashioned
method of procreation. Cloning opponents have explicitly stated this many
times. House Majority Leader Dick Armey said that "to be human is to be
made in the image and likeness of a loving God &hellip; creating multiple
copies of God's unique handiwork" is bad for a variety of reasons. Senator
Kit Bond says that "humans are not God and they should not be allowed to
play God." Albert Moraczewski, a theologian with the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops, argues that "cloning exceeds the limits of the
delegated dominions given to the human race."<a href="#13" class="footnote">13</a>
</p>
<p>
Cloning has also been criticized for the potential of misuse. It has been
speculated that people would utilize the procedure for the wrong reasons.
It is generally conceded that an infertile couple who cannot conceive a
child by any other means may be a legitimate case for
cloning&mdash;although many would deny them even this and recommend
adoption. Tougher cases abound. What about the couple with predispositions
for genetically-transmitted diseases who are very capable of reproduction
but don't for fear of transmission? Cloning would be a method to conceive
a child without fear of such diseases. What about the couple that desires
a child just like one of them, <em>i.e.</em>, for narcissistic purposes?
Anti-cloners&mdash;for lack of a better term&mdash;would definitely say
that is a wrong reason. What about using cloning for eugenic purposes,
<em>i.e.</em>, to create 'better' people? Certainly not. In fact, Ian
Wilmut himself cannot conceive of a valid purpose of cloning: "For me
personally &hellip; I still have not heard a suggested use for copying a
person that I find acceptable."<a href="#14" class="footnote">14</a>
</p>
<p>
The one scientific argument against cloning is that it flies in the face
of necessary genetic diversity. The gene pool must not become a gene
bathtub, or humanity will suffer. The fear is that massive cloning would
lead to mass plagues as pathogens gain the upper hand in scores of similar
immune systems. As one National Public Radio commentator observed,
"Diversity isn't just politically correct, it's good science." It is
similar to agriculture where cloning and genetic manipulation has been
occurring for a long time. If everyone were to use the same hybrid, and
that hybrid was prone to a certain pest, there would be widespread crop
failure.<a href="#15" class="footnote">15</a>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, each of these objections to cloning is erroneous. Cloning
is unnatural only in the sense that it is not the process by which humans
ordinarily procreate. What does that mean, though? We humans do a great
many things that our primitive ancestors never envisioned or were even
able to envision. The natural order of things is not an unqualified good.
The fatalism of this proposition is very hard to defend when examples of
man's achievement are put forth. What if mankind had accepted the
inevitability of disease and plague? What if mankind had never sought to
ameliorate the human condition and extend the lives of its members? What
if mankind had never created the creature comforts that have become
standard in the civilized world? Certainly, no one would argue that we
would better off if we had remained strictly hunter-gatherers. As British
philosopher John Gray said, "For millennia, people have been born, have
suffered pain and illness, and have died, without those occurrences being
understood as treatable diseases."<a href="#16" class="footnote">16</a>
</p>
<p>
Yet they do argue that science must be halted. A ban on cloning, however,
will have incredible consequences. To be sure, they will largely be
unseen. Who can count the number of people who would have been saved had
some genetic disease been taken out prior to conception? How many
infertile couples would have benefited from another option? It is
impossible to know, though we do know that these two scenarios would
occur. As Ronald Bailey put it, "trying to exercise prior restraint on
scientific and medical research is fraught with moral peril."<a href="#17" class="footnote">17</a>
Cloning discoveries and advances would lead to cures for AIDS, cancer,
Tay-Sachs, and heart disease&mdash;geneticists can already see how this
may be accomplished using DNA manipulation. To nip this research in the
bud is to be a party to the human misery that will inevitably continue. In
fact, <cite>The New England Journal of Medicine</cite> has stated that it
believes any ban on research to be "seriously misguided" and that research
on somatic cell nuclear transfer needs "nurturing before it can be branded
a success or failure."<a href="#18" class="footnote">18</a>
</p>
<p>
This aiding and abetting of human suffering is the real hubris. No one is
advocating a government-sponsored eugenics plan or government-sponsored
cloning. Anyone who engaged in these activities would be doing so
privately and voluntarily. It is quintessential arrogance to think that
you alone possess true wisdom and that you therefore must prevent people
from harming themselves&mdash;that you alone know what's best for them.
"We control all other aspects of our children's lives and identities
through powerful social and environmental influences and, in some cases,
with the use of powerful drugs like Ritalin and Prozac," observes Lee
Silver, author of the recent book <cite>Remaking Eden</cite>. "On what
basis can we reject positive genetic influences on a person's essence when
we accept the rights of parents to benefit their children in every other
way?"<a href="#19" class="footnote">19</a>
</p>
<p>
When we recognize the right of individuals to do whatever they want with
their bodies free of government restraint, how can we ban cloning? In
1942, the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a law that required the
sterilization of convicted criminals. It asserted that reproduction is
"one of the basic civil rights of man."<a href="#20" class="footnote">20</a>
The abortion debate centers around the same issue. How can anyone tell his
fellow man what he can and cannot do with his own body?
</p>
<p>
Moreover, it is not at all clear why cloning is immoral. Certainly, it has
been declared to be so by any number of authorities, but why? Cloning has
been going on for millennia, under a different name of
course&mdash;identical twins. The clone would be fully human. True, he
would be a different age than his twin but what would that matter? "You
should treat all clones like you would treat all monozygous twins or
triplets," Dr. H. Tristam Engelhardt, a professor of medicine at Baylor
and a philosopher at Rice, argues. "That's it."<a href="#21" class="footnote">21</a>
If a clone is essentially an identical twin separated by time, its moral
status becomes obvious. It is a human being, period.
</p>
<p>
Many scary scenarios have been provided showing clones being abused or
used for spare parts. This, however, is ludicrous if we understand a clone
to be a human being. All human beings, by virtue of existence, have
"certain inalienable rights" that cannot be trampled. Therefore, anyone
who enacted such scenarios would be guilty of violating the clone's
individual rights and subject to prosecution to the fullest extent of the
law, as if he had committed such acts on a 'real' person.
</p>
<p>
Ronald Bailey proposed an interesting thought experiment in an article of
his on the subject which clearly illustrates the principle involved:
</p>
<blockquote>
If tomorrow someone could prove that you were a clone, would you think
your life was worth less, that your loves and experiences were devalued?
You would be the same person you always were. Nothing would be different
simply because you were born from a "previously experienced genome," in
the tortured language of the cloning prohibitionists. A clone would likely
have no more issues about self-worth and life chances than test-tube
babies or adopted children do today.<a href="#22" class="footnote">22</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
This analogy is especially appropriate since clones would bear no external
indications of their conception and would therefore face the same issues
as adopted children.
</p>
<p>
The one scientific objection raised is similarly easily dismissed. Crops
are not human beings. Whereas agricultural scientists may use one plant
for copying, human beings will never clone just one person. It is crazy to
assume that there would be millions of versions of one individual running
around. That is the only situation where genomic diversity would be at
risk. Even then, science and technology would surely be able to control
the pathogens much like they eradicated the various diseases that existed
in epidemics in earlier times.
</p>
<p>
If the controversy about cloning is nonsensical, why all the fuss? From
the statements I have scattered around this essay, I have concluded that
the opposition to cloning stems from philosophical grounds. Although the
anti-cloners may couch their antipathy in scientific terms or safety
issues, the real motivation is subterranean. Anti-cloning is but one
application of a philosophy prevalent today. This philosophy is
anti-technology, anti-man, and anti-life.
</p>
<p>
This anti-technology I mention is best suggested by the 'unnatural'
argument. The Industrial Revolution has been assailed for being unnatural.
The free world's current luxurious lifestyle has been derided as harmful
to the natural world. Those who use this argument would have mankind
revert to the status of ten thousand years ago. To them, technology is not
an unqualified good and progress something to be stopped. The betterment
of man's life brought about by cloning breakthroughs and other related
advances cannot be a bad thing. "Without machines and technology, the task
of mere survival is a terrible, mind-and-body wrecking ordeal,"
philosopher Ayn Rand concluded. "In 'nature,' the struggle for food,
clothing, and shelter consumes all of a man's energy and spirit&hellip;."<a href="#23" class="footnote">23</a>
Who could reasonably argue that we are worse off because we live longer
and better than our primitive ancestors?
</p>
<p>
Similarly, proponents of this philosophy are anti-man. They do not regard
man as a part of the natural world they revere. "Until such time as
<em>Homo sapiens</em> should decide to rejoin nature, some of us can only
hope for the right virus to come along," is the way biologist David M.
Graber put it in <cite>The Los Angeles Times</cite>.<a href="#24" class="footnote">24</a>
Man, who has unleashed technology on the earth, must control his ways. Man
has overstepped the bounds of his domain and must be checked. What
rationale could underlie such a premise?
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, those who are anti-technology and anti-man succumb to
anti-life views. Cloning offers hope to those who suffer from horrid
genetic diseases and their unborn children. It is of inestimable benefit
to mankind. It will help infertile couples&mdash;which currently number
15% of the American population<a href="#25" class="footnote">25</a>&mdash;to
realize their dreams of family. To the opponents, people's lives should be
"brutish, nasty, and short," in Hobbes' classic formulation. How could
anyone be anti-life?
</p>
<p>
It is hard to imagine that anyone could hold these viewpoints, but they
do. Before you is the evidence of such beliefs. Several pieces of
legislation seeking anything from a five-year moratorium to an outright
ban on cloning are currently before Congress. It is unclear at this time
whether or not they will be successful. The future of mankind and our
standard of living is at stake. There now exist several diseases for which
no cure is known. Without progress in medicine, man's life <em>will</em>
suffer. There has always been opposition to new technologies&mdash;voices
crawling out of the woodwork decrying man's arrogance&mdash;and most of
the time these new technologies have been implemented. I can only hope
that cloning will not be among those that have been restricted.

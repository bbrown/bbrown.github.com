<br />Okay, Episodes 1 and 2 sucked bad. By the <a href="http://phatooine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1685">swirling</a> <a href="http://phatooine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1722">rumors</a> about Episode 3, I can't see how it could be any worse and it sounds a far sight better. I wasn't sure how George Lucas was going to pull off the transition from Episode 2 to Episode 4, but this conjecture seems reasonable enough. I'm actually excited to see Episode 3, replacing the resigned indifference I had previously felt.<br /><br />Best <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=88791&amp;cid=7682642">comment</a> from the <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/10/1742212&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=101&amp;tid=188&amp;tid=97">Slashdot discussion</a>: "I find your lack of bandwidth disturbing."<br /><br /><br />

<br />I'm happy to say that I can finally discuss what I've been working on for these last four months. Bob Parsons, my employer, spilled the <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/ThebestwaytogetcooperationOnpatrolwiththePhoenixPDAwinedrinkingmonkeyt.html?serendipity[searchTerm]=#c8861">beans on his blog</a> in a comment. The Go Daddy Personal Website and Weblog Guidelines state that I cannot "disclose any information that is confidential or proprietary to the company or to any third party that has a relationship with the company." That means I can confirm its existence though I can't go into any further details.<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

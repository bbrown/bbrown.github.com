<br /><a href="http://java.sun.com/people/jag/">James Gosling</a>, father of <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a>, responds in <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/jag/page4.html#36">his blog</a> to a troll with considerable insight into the design decisions he made when creating Java. As a bonus, he heaps praise on <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> and mentions that <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> is his development environment (plus <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>, but who's counting?).<br /><br />[UPDATE (8/6/03): This <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1210897,00.asp">eWeek article</a> quotes Jonathan Schwartz, executive vice president of software at Sun, as saying that practically every Sun employee owns a Macintosh at home. Very interesting.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 2 (8/6/03): <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/06/1550220">Slashdot</a> has picked up the article.]<br /><br /><br />

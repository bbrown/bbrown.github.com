<br /><a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1016_3-5327335.html">Shorthorn</a>: good one, Allchin; I hadn't even thought of that. Notable: next version of Windows will <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/08/28/windows.release.reut/index.html">ship sometime</a> in 2006 and <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Longhorn/WinFS.asp">WinFS</a> won't <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=119715&amp;cid=10096028">be in it</a>. Oh and everything else that would be cool in Longhorn will be released for XP and Win2k. Move on, nothing to see here.<br /><br />As for me and my family, we'll install <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">Tiger</a> in January 2005.<br /><br /><br />

<p id="walking-intro">
With all of the linking I've been doing lately, I have noticed that it's really hard to go directly to a particular quote or part of a much-longer essay. My pointers, therefore, often require the reader to wade through a lot of detail to get to the underlying message. "If only people would dutifully place 'id' attributes throughout their paragraphs, I would be able to send my reader directly to the right place," I would think to myself.

<p id="walking-solution">
But <em>I</em> don't do anything like that. How can I expect everyone else to do it if I won't lead by example? Good point, rhetorical question! With the last couple posts, I have added "id" attributes to each and every paragraph. So if you wanted to send someone to my post on <a href="http://bbrown.info/2008/10/13/why-i-voted-for-mccain.aspx">why I voted for John McCain</a> and specifically the part where I discuss the Republicans under an Obama presidency, you can view the HTML source and see that <a href="http://bbrown.info/2008/10/13/why-i-voted-for-mccain.aspx#why-obama-opposition-refutation">this link</a> (<code>http://bbrown.info/2008/10/13/why-i-voted-for-mccain.aspx#why-obama-opposition-refutation</code>) will take you there.

After writing that last sentence, i realize that I need to make this a little more discoverable. The first task is to put in that metadata&#x2014;interested parties will find it&#x2014;but then I need to make it useful to anyone.

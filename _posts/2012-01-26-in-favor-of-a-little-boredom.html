<a href="http://kimsplayplace.blogspot.com/2012/01/12-year-olds-view-of-middle-school.html" title="This post is inspired by Kim's blog entry but it's not entirely a response to hers.">School can be boring.</a>
</p>
<p>
Let me put the emphasis where I mean it: school <em>can</em> be boring. So can work. So can life.
</p>
<p>
I'm not going to say that the purpose of school is to be tedious. But learning and mastery aren't supposed to be effortless. You have to learn things that maybe you don't want to because they're a) foundational and b) important. For a child, it'd be great to stick only to what interests you and skip the math drills. And it's tempting to think that a child-centered education might result in more engagement and thus more learning.
</p>
<p>
But that's not how life works. You can't only work on the fun projects at your office; someone needs to wipe out the toilets; and there's always paperwork to be filed. There's going to be a boss and he's going to tell you to do things. If you cut and run because man that guy's always droning on about the proper sequence to assemble the widget, then you're not going to be employed for long.
</p>
<p>
Knowing how to handle being bored and follow directions is a life skill. Finding the value in relationships with people unlike yourself (or maybe even beneath your level of intelligence) will serve you for the rest of your life. School is a great place to acquire and practice those skills. If you indulge your child's self-absorption, you're not doing him any favors and disappointment is going to be a theme throughout his life.

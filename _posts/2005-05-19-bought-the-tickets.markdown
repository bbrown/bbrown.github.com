<br />Well, I now own the right for two to sit in the <a href="https://www.movietickets.com/pre_purchase.asp?afid=moviefone&amp;house_id=7229&amp;movie_id=44828&amp;edata=11150">Harkins Arrowhead 18 theater with the digital projector</a> on Saturday, May 21th at 8:50 am. What am I going to see? <cite>Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</cite>. Oh yeah!<br /><br />[UPDATE (5/20/05): Through a fortuitous Netflix return, I got <cite>Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</cite> this afternoon. Refreshed my memory, I have.]<br /><br /><br />

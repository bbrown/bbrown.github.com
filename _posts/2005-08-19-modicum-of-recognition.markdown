<br />Today was a red-letter day for me. This morning, I saw a referrer on my link blog, <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/">Found on the Web</a>, to a Kinja account. Naturally, I followed the link back to its source and discovered that I was included in the feeds that <a href="http://burri.to/~joshua/">Joshua Schachter</a> follows. If you don't know Joshua Schachter, he's the guy that created <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://www.geourl.org/">GeoURL</a>, and <a href="http://www.memepool.com/">Memepool</a>. As I've <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/delicioso.cfm">mentioned previously</a>, I love del.icio.us and Memepool was my inspiration for Found on the Web. I'm not the only one in his feeds, but the fact that I merited an inclusion at all is a tremendous honor to me.<br /><br />As if that wasn't enough, I met <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/">Bob Parsons</a> in the break room at work. He said that he's been meaning to introduce himself&#x2014;something that I've heard he tries to do to new employees&#x2014;and inquired as to what sort of work I did for him. I explained my role to him in increasingly effusive excitement. Towards the end, I was positively bubbly. It wasn't fake, either: I am really, really jazzed about this product I'm working on. He paid me a great compliment by saying that he was glad that I was so excited about it and that it was nice to hear. I am certainly glad that his first impression of me wasn't <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/meeting-the-president-sort-of.cfm">almost knocking him down</a>.<br /><br /><br />

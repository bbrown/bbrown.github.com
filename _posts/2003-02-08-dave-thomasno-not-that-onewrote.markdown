<br />Dave Thomas&#x2014;no, not that one&#x2014;wrote a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="The Pragmatic Programmer">great book</a> that you absolutely must read if you want to be a better programmer. The book's site also has some great resources as well: a <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?LanguageOfTheYear">wiki</a>, a talk entitled <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/talks/HowToKeepYourJob/HTKYJ.html" title="How to keep your job by adding value as a programmer">"How to Keep Your Job,"</a> and <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/articles/index.html">articles and essays</a>.<br /><br />He now has a <a href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave" title="PragDave">blog</a>. And it is fantastic. What's even more exciting, at least from my perspective, is that he's an <a href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Apple">avid</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> <a href="http://www.xusers.org/" title="He's not actually a member.">user</a>.<br /><br /><br />

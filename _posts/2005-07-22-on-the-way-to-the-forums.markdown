<br /><a href="http://getvanilla.com/">Vanilla</a>: Vanilla is a brand new open-source forum software that's stated goal is to "the mold created and followed by just about every other forum on the web." This jibes with my experience in bulletin boards&#x2014;I've found them pretty much all the same, even down to their interfaces. The only other different forum software I've run across is <a href="http://www.punbb.org/">PunBB</a> and that's not <em>that</em> different.<br /><br />Sometimes it's good to follow the pack: conventions make user interfaces easier for users to understand. Most of the time, to my mind at least, it's great to re-examine the premises of commodity software and see if there's still some innovation to be had. I'm definitely going to try out Vanilla at my community's fledgling virtual community.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I was going to write up an essay on America's War on Terrorism for 9/11 but a lot of things got in the way. I still have plans to write something up, but here's some articles to tide you over:<ul><li><a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/news/local/6742902.htm">Lingering questions about 9/11</a></li><li><a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2002/09/11/forbidden_letters/index.html">Forbidden thoughts about 9/11</a></li></ul><br />These don't represent the tack I was going to (or am going to) take, but they're very interesting.<br /><br /><br />

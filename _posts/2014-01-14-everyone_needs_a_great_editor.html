One of the things that I'm most enjoying about my move back to development is regaining mastery of the text editor. There is nothing like wielding a powerful text editor effectively. Visual Studio is an impressive <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym> but its text editing powers never wowed me like others I've used in the past. The one I'm using now is better than any I've experienced.
</p>
<p>
I'm speaking, of course, about <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" title="Its name continues a rich tradition of poor naming choices going back decades.">Sublime Text</a>. I bought it with my own money, which is high praise considering the dearness of its price and my, um, frugality. It's the first editor that holds a candle to jEdit, my <a href="http://bbrown.info/2003/07/the-little-ide-that-could.html" title="It ran on the JVM of 2003 and it used Swing, I believe. It is astounding it was as performant as it was, especially given all of the plugins I threw at it.">previous winner</a> in the category.
</p>
<p>
The thing is it's far better than <a href="http://jedit.org/" title="Amazingly, the site still looks very familiar. They've even had several releases this year! I'm tempted, but ST3 is where it's at.">jEdit</a>! Here are just a few of the reasons (here are <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/sublime-text-2-tips-and-tricks/">more of them</a>):
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-3-public-beta">Speed</a>. It is really close to instantaneous.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/stats" title="Yowza!">plugin ecosystem</a> is far better than anything else I've seen. </li>
<li>The <a href="https://tutsplus.com/lesson/the-command-palette/" title="This short video is worth watching. Your mouth should be agape by the end.">command palette</a> practically embeds <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" title="If you're not using Alfred, then you need to fix that immediately.">Alfred</a> in the editor.</li>
<li>Keyboard operation is an <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/key-bindings" title="The preferences system for this is a little odd, but its inheritance paradigm makes a lot of sense for portability.">integral component</a>. And I'm all about mouse avoidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm trying to build up my ST skills gradually, integrating a new one only after I've hit my stride on an existing one. I'm very productive so far, but I can still see a lot of room for improvement.

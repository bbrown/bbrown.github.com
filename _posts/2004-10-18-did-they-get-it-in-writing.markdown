<br /><a href="http://washingtontimes.com/national/20041018-124854-2279r.htm">"Released prisoners commit terrorism"</a>: I can't believe it. They promised to not become terrorists, we released them, and they broke their promises. I guess you just can't take terrorists at their word. I hope this was a learning experience for the Pentagon.<br /><br /><br />

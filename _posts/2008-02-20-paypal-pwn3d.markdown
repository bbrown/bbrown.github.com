I was balancing my checkbook this morning when I discovered two charges I didn't recognize. My wife does her fair share of online transacting, so I asked her what they were. She couldn't remember so I did what I normally do: investigate. Most of the time, my research jogs her memory and I can dutifully assign the transaction the appropriate category in Quicken. This time was different.

I went to PayPal and discovered two illicit transactions in euros to RapidShare. On my online banking site, I found a charge from Yahoo Small Business Hosting. Crap! The guy had changed my email address to a Yahoo one (the same one, incidentally, used to register a domain and set up hosting) and I promptly changed my password. I completed the PayPal dispute form.

I went to Yahoo and tried to login for the guy (hoping he had used my compromised password&#x2014;a guy can dream, y'know). From my attempt to reset his password, I determined that he had my debit card number! I reported the card stolen and I think all of his attack vectors are closed off. I had only used my PayPal password once before with a wholly unrelated email address so I'm not worried about him ruining my online life.

Sandi and I were trying to think of how we got compromised. It seems like a textbook case of phishing, but Sandi is pretty aware of that and her computer has nothing stored in Keychain for that PayPal account. I'm very aware of phishing and I haven't been to PayPal in a very long time. What's particularly confounding is the Yahoo account, which was definitely established with a credit card number and not through PayPal. Very strange, but all is being resolved now.

The moral of this story is to balance your account regularly&#x2014;I last did it on February 8th. If I had waited longer, there's no telling how much more damage this a-hole could have done. I'm truly surprised at how little he did&#x2014;maybe he's a slacker&#x2014;so I guess I lucked out by not being violated by someone with ambition and drive.

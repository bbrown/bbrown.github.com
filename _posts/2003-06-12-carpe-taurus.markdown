<br />Carpe taurus! <a href="http://www.dc.com/bullfighter/">Seize the bull</a>!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dc.com/">Deloitte &amp; Touche Consulting</a> is offering a plug-in buzzword detector for Windows called Bullfighter. It adds a toolbar to your Office apps that acts like a spelling or grammar checker, except that it checks for verbiage and business effluvia. What an awesome app! And it's free. What I don't get is how a major consulting firm got so clueful. <a href="http://blog.stealthmode.com/">Francine Hardaway</a> of <a href="http://www.stealthmode.com/">Stealthmode Partners</a> has all of the <a href="http://blog.stealthmode.com/2003_06_01_stealthmodepart_archive.html#200388934" title="Hmm, her archives don't seem to be working.

<br />Scott Guthrie <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/12/14/433194.aspx">posted some code</a> that can be put in your Global file's Application_End event handler that will log the reason for the event's firing to the event log. That is some sweet .NET; it reminds me that I need to learn as much as I can about reflection.<br /><br /><br />

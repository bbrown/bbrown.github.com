I got home late on Tuesday, so I didn't have a chance to see <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/wipeout/"><cite>Wipeout</cite></a> live. I just finished watching it online and my <a href="/2008/05/29/summer-shows.aspx">earlier anticipation</a> was well-rewarded.
</p>
<p>
It is simply amazing. John Henson, who I loved on <cite>Talk Soup</cite> back in the day, offers excellent commentaryâ€”lapsing into puns facilely but without <cite>MXC</cite>'s innuendo-laced vulgarity. The obstacles are outstanding and punishing, which makes for great TV. And the final challenge is definitely an homage to <cite>Ninja Warrior</cite>, though less strenuous to be sure.

My Tuesdays evenings are now blocked out. (<cite>I Survived a Japanese Game Show</cite> was passable, but decidedly a little more focused on the personalities involved than the ludicrous challenges. It's a lot more <cite>Big Brother</cite> than <cite>MXC</cite>.)

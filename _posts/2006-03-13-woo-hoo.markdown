<p>Our team blog is now up and ready for business! It's called <a href="http://onlinequickblog.com/">Quick Blogging</a>, which is the name I came up with for the time being, and I've got <a href="http://onlinequickblog.com/2006/03/10/my-name-is-william-bill-for-short.aspx">the second entry</a>. It made it through the process with only the addition of the &#xAE; symbol.</p>
<p>I doubt anyone outside of the people I've directly told has been there, but that will soon change. I can't wait to see what sort of comments we get!</p>
<p>[UPDATE: Bonus points if you know where the post's title came from.]</p>
<p>[UPDATE (3/14/2006): Some fargin icehole named Roman Moroni <a href="http://onlinequickblog.com/2006/03/10/my-name-is-william-bill-for-short.aspx#comment-17285">left a comment</a>.]

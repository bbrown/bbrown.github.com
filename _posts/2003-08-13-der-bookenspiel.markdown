<br />Got the edits for my book proposal and sample chapter back from the agent. Nothing major&#x2014;apparently, the editor prefers "because" over "since" and likes to capitalize the command key&#x2014;so I turned them around pretty quickly and they're back in his hands. Next step: send them off to <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a> so they can get excited about them and immediately whip up a contract with a sizable advance. I'm shooting for $3,596: $149 for <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?productLearnMore=T7538LL/A">Microsoft Office.X</a>, $2699 for the <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-780-5009/WebObjects/EducationIndividual.woa/70501/wo/jBeGvHR0Omfk2LhWN3F2Ranv1yz/0.0.7.1.0.5.59.0.0.1.7.6.1.1.0">dual 2GHz G5</a>, $149 for the iSight, and $599 for a <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-780-5009/WebObjects/EducationIndividual.woa/70501/wo/jBeGvHR0Omfk2LhWN3F2Ranv1yz/1.0.7.1.0.5.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.3.1.1.0?77,76">17" flat screen</a>. C'mon, I need a good, quality system to write on. You think my crappy 15" PowerBook G4 is going to cut it? Geesh.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I'm not normally a big fan of Thomas Sowell (but he's a <a href="/values/people/thomassowell.cfm">value of yours</a>, you might ask&#x2026;that he's my favorite editorial columnist and I can say that I'm not a big fan should tell you the barrenness of the field), but his recent column entitled <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20031230.shtml">"Two earthquakes"</a> is spot on. When I was listening to an NPR report this morning on rescue operations in Bam, I was thinking exactly what he said in that editorial&#x2014;"there but for the grace of God" never crossed my mind.<br /><br /><br />

<br />Didn't I say I wasn't going to blog anymore for awhile? Like eight entries ago? I said that I was going to try to focus on my s00per sekrit project, but <a href="http://www.fivebrowns.com/category/madeline/">our daughter</a> was born April 20th and I took two weeks off from work&#x2014;I just haven't had time to devote to that project so I guess I figured why not blog here?<br /><br />I'll warn you, though: it could stop at any minute. So get your fill while you can.<br /><br /><br />

<br /><a href="http://web.okaygo.co.uk/apps/letters/flashcom/">Just Letters</a>: this is the coolest thing. It's amazing to watch how people move from just moving letters around to trying to achieve tasks. Once the task becomes obvious then dozens of people join in.<br /><br />We were playing around with it at work and I discovered several fun sub-games that people joined: move all the letters into one corner, put every instance of a particular letter together so it appears as one single letter, and move all letters of one color into a particular area. I also noticed several other games people had devised: some pervert continued to make "T" and "U" interact, form a line with all of the letters, and make shapes using the letters.<br /><br />It's really quite fascinating to watch.<br /><br /><br />

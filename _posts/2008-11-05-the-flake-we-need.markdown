<a href="http://flake.house.gov/">Jeff Flake</a>'s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/04/AR2008110403872.html">editorial</a> in the <cite>Washington Post</cite> today is exactly what I needed this morning. It's exactly what I would have liked the losing presidential candidate to have said in a concession speech:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I suggest that we return to first principles. At the top of that list has to be a recommitment to limited government. After eight years of profligate spending and soaring deficits, voters can be forgiven for not knowing that limited government has long been the first article of faith for Republicans.
</p>
<p>
Second, we need to recommit to our belief in economic freedom. Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations" may be on the discount rack this year, but the free market is still the most efficient means to allocate capital and human resources in an economy, and Americans know it. Now that we've inserted government deeply into the private sector by bailing out banks and businesses, the temptation will be for government to overstay its welcome and force the distribution of resources to serve political ends. Substituting political for economic incentives is not the recipe for economic recovery.

<br />I debated about posting these two articles I found because they're somewhat out of character for this blog (though I've blogged <a href="2003_07_27_diamonds.cfm#105971571252522972">the subject</a> before). Ultimately, I think sex is important and that improving one's technique is always of value. If you're <a href="http://religion.aynrand.org/sex.html">prudish</a>, don't click through. I'm not, so what the hell!<br /><br />Mind-blowing cunnilingus: <a href="http://www.mun.ca/muse/archive/Volume54/Issue14/opinion/index.php?articleid=1745">part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.mun.ca/muse/opinion/index.php?articleid=1895">part 2</a><br /><br />As per my <a href="/blogs/policy.cfm">policy</a>, I won't be following up this post.<br /><br /><br />

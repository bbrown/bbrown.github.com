<br />Wow, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>'s sold 700,000 <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPods</a>.<br /><br />He's announcing third-generation iPods: 10GB (mine), 15GB, and 30GB. They're thinner and lighter than two CDs! They've also got a new interface with four extra buttons (which are backlit) and a dock, which has a line out as well for playing on other audio. They've got FireWire and USB2.0 connections.<br /><br /><br />

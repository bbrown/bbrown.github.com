<br />I'm speechless about this <a href="http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/MOTHER_CHARGED?SITE=TXCOL&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">article</a>.<br /><br />I'm pro-choice and I believe that a fetus has no rights until birth, so I believe this lady did <strong>not</strong> commit murder. But I still think she is a monster who doesn't deserve any children. To willingly let one unborn baby die because you didn't want the scar of a Caesarean section is unconscionable. I say unconscionable because that's the closest approximation of the disgust and revulsion I'm feeling.<br /><br />This is definitely one of those cases that tests your resolve about your principles, like defending a neo-Nazi's free speech&#x2014;though that's orders of magnitude easier.<br /><br />[UPDATE (3/16/04): <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=533&amp;e=6&amp;u=/ap/20040314/ap_on_re_us/mother_charged">Apparently</a>, this lady was the monster she seemed from this incident.]<br /><br /><br />

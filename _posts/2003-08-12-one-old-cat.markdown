<br />Our main cat, Francisco, turned 10 years old today. If you ever see a stoned-looking, orange cat in my pic o' the day, that's him in his younger days (probably five or six judging by the bondi blue iMac in the picture).<br /><br />He's not as spry as he used to be, but the new cat Darla has really been good for him since she's maybe two or three years old. He's more active than he's been in a long time.<br /><br /><br />

<br />"History is the laboratory of philosophy."<br /><br />That's a pregnant and profound thought. It's what got me into history after I couldn't complete my philosophy degree. It perfectly captures the importance of history and the relationship of the past to philosophy.<br /><br />The one problem with the above quotation is that I have no idea its source. It's been so long since I've seen it that its origin is murky. I honestly can't remember whether I came up with it or read it somewhere. I've searched Google using every possible combination, to absolutely no avail. If I came up with it, then I'll be exceedingly proud of myself but I can't bring myself to claim authorship.<br /><br />Does anyone know of the quote or its origin? Leave a comment or send me an <a href="/contact/">email</a>. I'll be in your debt.<br /><br /><br />

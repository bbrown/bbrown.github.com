<br />While watching the <a href="http://www.expn.com/">X Games</a> last night, I saw a commercial for <a href="http://www.joeboxer.com/">Joe Boxer</a> that I hadn't seen before that featured a dancing, ebullient <a href="http://www.aboutvaughn.com/">Vaughn Lowery</a>. I had seen him in a previous commercial and enjoyed it thoroughly, but had forgotten about his mesmerizing style until now. If you haven't seen it, it's quite hypnotic. I rewound TiVo two or three times, cracking up louder each take.<br /><br />How did they come up with this dance, now called the "Joe Boxer Boogie"? According to Lowery's account of the audition,<blockquote>I just pulled down my pants, I went in and they played some music and I did my thing. We did 25 takes of it, non-stop, and all the dances I choreographed myself. &#x2014;<a href="http://www.tvacres.com/admascots_joe_boxer.htm">TVAcres</a></blockquote>I'm sure that's exactly how many porn stars started out as well.<br /><br /><br />

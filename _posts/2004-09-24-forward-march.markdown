<br />Why do people forward hoax emails to everyone they know? I just got <a href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/parental/archer.htm">this little gem</a> from a teller at a distant branch who in her infinite wisdom decided to forward it along to everyone in the organization. It was recalled less than five minutes after she hit send (and I forwarded her a link to the Snopes article cited above), but what would possess someone to do such an act?<br /><br />It would be easy to trot out the "stupid people" or "credulous Web user" theses, but there are far more of either category than the number of hoax emails I get forwarded. In other words, I know there are plenty of stupid and/or gullible people who don't forward this trash. So what gives?<br /><br />They're people who believe what they read and spread it to inform anyone they can. Psychologically, I think they're probably trying to attract attention to themselves in some fashion&#x2014;Chicken Little's with a modicum of crying wolf thrown in. Epistemologically, they're probably concrete-bound, distintegrated types. They clearly aren't able to critically process information and it's scary.<br /><br /><br />

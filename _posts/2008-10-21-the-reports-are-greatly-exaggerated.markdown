Something's going on over at <cite>The Washington Post</cite>. First, they publish an article entitled <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/15/AR2008101503166.html">"Don't Blame Capitalism"</a>. Now there's an unsigned editorial <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/19/AR2008101901416.html">affirming</a> that the "unregulated free-for-all financial sector" wasn't free. This represents a different tack from the one taken <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/09/AR2008100903425.html">earlier</a>.

I'm not going to go crazy and get all hopeful about this turn, but I am glad that the editors at <cite>WaPo</cite> are willing to acknowledge the government's role in both catalyzing and aggravating this financial problem.

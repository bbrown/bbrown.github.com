<br />I just got done watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CY5P/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Crazy/Beautiful</cite></a> and I am really impressed. I think <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Dunst,+Kirsten" title="IMDB link">Kirsten Dunst</a> is an underrated actress who hopefully has a very long career ahead of her. She is convincing as both a spoiled daughter of a Congressman living self-destructively and as a troubled teenager coming to grips with her feelings.<br /><br />On the one hand, it's a typical teen flick about the seeming life-altering impact of being in love at that age. Nicole (Dunst) falls in love with Carlos (Jay Hernandez), a kid bused in from a poorer neighborhood with ambitions of making something of himself. A rich, white girl falling in love with a poor, Latino boy from the wrong side of the tracks has certainly been done to death.<br /><br />What was different about this movie was the realism of the portrayal. The gritty, raw performance of Nicole's descent struck a chord with me. I got involved with her character; I believed that she was really going through the events in the story. When she finally hit rock bottom and realized the consequences of the path she was travelling, I actually cared. I finished the movie genuinely happy that she was going to be alright.<br /><br />In sum, I consider this a really good movie that is worthy of rental and purchase. I would rent it just to make sure that it doesn't bother you and then purchase it once you discover what a good movie it is.<br /><br /><br />

"In the first 100 days of our administration, we will look at every agency and department and expenditure of the federal government and ask this simple question: Is it serving the needs of the taxpayer? If it is not, we will reform it or shut it down, and we will spend money only on what is truly in the interest of the American people." â€” John McCain and Sarah Palin, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_print/SB122091995349512749.html">"We'll Protect Taxpayers From More Bailouts"</a>
<p>
If only this were true. Something tells me that they'll have an expansive idea of "reform[ing] it." Or they'll take a statist notion of what's "in the interest of the American people."

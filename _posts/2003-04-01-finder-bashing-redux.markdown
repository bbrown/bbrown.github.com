<br />John Siracusa is at it again, this time leveling his sights on the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/paedia/f/finder/finder-1.html">Mac OS X Finder</a>. This article, which I've just started, is just as thorough and thoughtful as <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-1.html" title="Awesome review of Jaguar">any</a> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/01q4/macosx-10.1/macosx-10.1.html" title="Review of 10.1">he's</a> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/01q3/metadata/metadata-1.html" title="On the cessation of requiring the resource fork...">written</a> for <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a>. I'll probably update this entry with my thoughts on his thoughts later today. In the meantime, you should read it.<br /><br />[UPDATE 4/3/03] I didn't get a chance to post my thoughts yesterday, mostly because it took me most of yesterday to slog through the entire article. It was entirely worth it as I expected and I am now more of a Siracusa fan than I was before. I disagree with him on several points, but his arguments are presented exceptionally well.<br /><br /><strong>Where I agree:</strong> live search folders, the shelf, the Finder <em>qua</em> browser<br /><br /><strong>Where I disagree:</strong> inviolable spatiality, Finder plug-ins<br /><br /><a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/">Some</a> might think that the article is much ado about nothing and will never see the light of day, but I think that the piece is geared towards advancing HCI thought. I particularly liked Siracusa's point that humans are adept at handling physical clutter but awful at dealing with mental clutter. That is a pregnant thought for my own interface and interaction work.<br /><br /><br />

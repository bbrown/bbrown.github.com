<br />Iran <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/headline/world/2791903">says</a> that the massing of troops along the Iran-Iraq border is to deter the "great powers" from moving into Iran, but something tells me that the Iraqi terrorist groups aren't the only ones that smell weakness in America's Iraqi positions. Sweet fancy Moses!<br /><br />[UPDATE: This setup reminds me a little of the Korean War. We were worried that Korea was going to fall into Communist China's clutch so we invaded, bringing China into the war. Iran has always had designs on Iraq and they probably don't want us running the show. So if they invade, we'll be brought into the war with Iran. I would actually welcome this because Iran is a despicable, illegitimate state. It supports terrorism in particular and Islamic fundamentalism in general. Iran is the nation that we should have invaded. I guess it didn't fulfill the vendetta like Iraq did.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />This is the last post I'll have today because I am going to some <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&amp;EventID=1032235756">ASP.NET training</a> at the local Microsoft office and tonight is all birthday all the time.<br /><br />Normal posting will resume tomorrow. Thanks for tuning in.<br /><br /><br />

<br /><a href="http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/071305-1.aspx">Database Projects in VisualStudio.NET</a>: I had no idea that there was such a thing. After reading the article, I'm sold. Working with, editing, and adding stored procedures from within VisualStudio.NET is a godsend after having spent the last month editing and creating stored procedures from within Enterprise Manager's <em>dialog box</em>.<br /><br />Who the hell thinks that a dialog box is an appropriate source code editor?! I know you get used to it&#x2014;I did&#x2014;but a good code editor adds a huge range of benefits with which any programmer is familiar.<br /><br /><br />

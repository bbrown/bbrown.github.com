<br />Man, what a week! I took Monday and Tuesday off to clean our house (shampoo the carpets, do the traditional spring cleaning), worked a half-day on Wednesday (went to a company-sponsored spring training game in the afternoon), and have been sick ever since. Bleh.<br /><br />So I haven't done much surfing and don't have much to share. I've watched plenty of <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/" title="Yeah, yeah, it's really positive war news, but I like that.">war coverage</a>, <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/" title="Bill Murray and Christopher Walken rock!">Saturday Night Live reruns</a>, and read a bunch. I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672316498/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Almost done. Hyperbolic, but compelling."><cite>The Inmates Are Running the Asylum</cite></a> by Alan Cooper, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/076241345X/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Excellent book so far."><cite>Mister Rogers Parenting Book</cite></a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0399550003/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="My boss's boss has discovered Deming and I want to be prepared."><cite>The Deming Management Method</cite></a>.by Mary Walton.<br /><br />I'm still getting back into the swing of things...<br /><br /><br />

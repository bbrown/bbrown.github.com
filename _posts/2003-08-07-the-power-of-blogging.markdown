<br />To illustrate the power of blogging, three days ago I carved a <a href="2003_08_03_diamonds.cfm#106003031851332003">paean mixed with homily</a> about my favorite shirt. Today, <em>I receive another shirt of the same brand and comfort</em>! The fact that today is my birthday is merely coincidental, I'm sure. My <a href="/values/people/sandibrown.cfm">lovely and esteemed wife</a> also gave me some exquisite Fiestaware flan-sized dishes&#x2014;ooo, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/3579471/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link">new color</a>.<br /><br /><br />

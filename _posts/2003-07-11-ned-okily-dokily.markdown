<br />I read <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/">Kevin Maney</a>'s <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2003-07-08-maney-x.htm">column</a> in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/"><cite>USA Today</cite></a>&#x2014;remember when <cite>USA Today</cite> was a junior upstart reviled by the established newspapers? You've come a long way, baby!&#x2014;about <a href="http://www.motorola.com/mediacenter/news/detail/0,1958,2981_2436_23,00.html">Motorola</a>'s new technology dubbed <acronym title="Nano Emissive Display">NED</acronym> yesterday and I am excited!<br /><br />Just the thought of today's flatscreen TVs at slimmer proportions for the price of today's 32-inch <acronym title="Cathode Ray Tube">CRT</acronym>s has me positively salivating. I've got two 27" televisions in my house and we've had them for well over six years. I just can't see myself spending the money on the new TVs at today's prices, but justifying these NEDs to myself is a piece of cake.<br /><br /><br />

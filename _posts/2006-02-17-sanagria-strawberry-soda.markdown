<p>I've long said that I've never met a strawberry soda that didn't suck. They're invariably too sweet. This one, however, isn’t half bad. It’s got a distinctive can/bottle and no aftertaste. <a href="http://www.sangaria.co.jp/seihin/tan_fld/big_tan/soda_pg.html">Official site</a><br /><br /><strong>4 of 5 stars.</strong></p>

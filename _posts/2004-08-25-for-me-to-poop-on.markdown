<br />I just rented <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002DB5OA/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>The Best of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog</cite></a>. I've been a fan of Triumph since his first appearance&#x2014;prior to The Girls, I was a regular Conan O'Brien watcher. This DVD is incredible: it includes just about every appearance in full. The highlights were definitely Triumph at the American Idol auditions in Hawaii, Triumph at the <cite>Star Wars: Attack of the Clones</cite> premiere, and Triumph interviewing celebrities on the red carpet.<br /><br />If you like Triumph, this is definitely a must purchase or rent. Triumph is definitely the best comic dog out there. He always brings the goods, night after night. Robert Smigel, the guy behind all this, is a comic genius. &#x2026;<br /><br /><br />

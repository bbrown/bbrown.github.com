<br />I am watching <cite>One Hour Photo</cite>, a thriller starring Robin Williams. It is creepy&#x2014;that word doesn't quite do it justice, perhaps chilling is better. Its world-view isn't mine, but it is exquisitely well-crafted and Robin Williams plays his character to perfection. His delusional fantasies, his obsessive shrine, his increasingly violent behavior, his stony demeanor, and his destitution of values combined with the utterly mundane nature of his life make for a very believable story.<br /><br />Each scene builds on the previous one, each leading to an inexorable though horrific conclusion. Haunting music is used effectively throughout as well. I enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I could ever watch it again&#x2014;it suggests that depravity can be found lurking behind every counter.<br /><br /><br />

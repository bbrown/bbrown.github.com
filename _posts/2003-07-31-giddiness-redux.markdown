<br />The <a href="2003_07_20_diamonds.cfm#105916270830806657">waiting game is over</a>: I just got word that the proposal was pretty good, requiring only a few changes. Unfortunately, the agent wants a sample chapter to include. Phew! Luckily, he'll wait a little longer for that, but the revised proposal has to be to him by Monday.<br /><br />I've got a feeling that this book is going to keep me very, very busy.<br /><br /><br />

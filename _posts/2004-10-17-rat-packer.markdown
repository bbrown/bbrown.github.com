<p>I'm no expert in campaign finance, but aren't you supposed to <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/scripts/cfs_committee.dll/TransDetail?CYCLE=2004&amp;PeriodID=4&amp;FILERID=200492094&amp;ID=D">refrain</a> <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/scripts/cfs_committee.dll/TransDetail?CYCLE=2004&amp;PeriodID=3&amp;FILERID=200492094&amp;ID=D">from</a> <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/scripts/cfs_committee.dll/TransDetail?CYCLE=2004&amp;PeriodID=2&amp;FILERID=200492094&amp;ID=D">treating</a> <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/scripts/cfs_committee.dll/TransDetail?CYCLE=2004&amp;PeriodID=1&amp;FILERID=200492094&amp;ID=D">your</a> <a href="">election</a> <a href="">committee</a> <a href="">funds</a> as a personal checking account? If I were a contributor, I'd be pissed.</p>
<p>Also, if you look nearly all the way down <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/scripts/cfs_committee.dll/TransDetail?CYCLE=2004&amp;PeriodID=2&amp;FILERID=200492094&amp;ID=D">this page</a>, you'll see an entry for "DMRW" on 3/4/04 for "fees." This would be utterly unremarkable were it not for the fact that the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=44444+N+Shangrila+Ln+new+river+arizona">address listed</a> had a rather un-Republican, un-family values <a href="http://www.shangrilaranch.com/">purpose</a>. Fees indeed!</p>
<p>Even though I went to middle and high school with him, I did not <a href="http://www.votedeanmartin.com/">vote for Dean Martin</a>. Ever since I have known him I have thought that he would either be a car salesman or a politician&#x2014;quite a prescient assessment. His views as evidenced on his campaign site and the questionnaire cover every Republican bromide out there and <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/city4/articles/0814phx-senatesix0814Z7.html">point</a> to a Bob Dole-style politician. (To give you an indication of his ambition, his sign design doesn't even list the office he's seeking.) No thanks!</p>
<p>So did I vote for Marla Wing, the <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/MEMUSIX1/myhomepage/profile.html">Democratic challenger</a>? Hell no, she's <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/issues/2002-09-05/speakeasy.html" title="Marla Wing, Certifiable">crazier than cotton</a> and <a href="http://pniext.pni.com/News/Cust/WebLeg2004.nsf/0/beabd6704189674c07256f1f00721456?OpenDocument">quite wrong</a> for my interests. Plus, my wife had her son as a student and had to endure her insanity at parent-teacher conferences: she confirms what article after article only hint at&#x2014;the woman ain't all there. (Side note: when you can't raise money except for $5 contributions from short-order cooks and the unemployed and you're forced to make campaign signs out of poster board and markers, you might want to cut your losses and go home.)</p>
<p>I did the only honorable thing when faced with such a choice at the very local level: I abstained. The Dean Martin steamroller doesn't need my support and there is <strong>no</strong> way that Marla Wing is getting into the state Senate (though it would definitely shake things up down there!).</p>
<p>[One programming note: this concludes the Bill Brown Information Center's foray into election commentary. It was short-lived and we like it like that.]</p>
<p>[UPDATE (11/26/04): The <cite>Arizona Republic</cite> has picked up this story and did a bit more investigating than I did. Apparently, a lot of the campaign money went back to <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/1121polinsider21.html">his own companies</a>. All of this came to light when a <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/1123montini23.html">constituent</a> informed the media of his self-dealing. I guess I should have done a little more research and made the information available to the media. Also, I guess the media isn't reading my blog. Heheh.]</p>
<p>[UPDATE (3/13/2006): Apparently, Dean's <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0223treasurer0223.html">running for State Treasurer</a>. His little scheme resurfaces in the comments and I think that such double dealing will come to haunt him in the run for State Treasurer, an office for which fiduciary responsibility and integrity is prime.]</p>

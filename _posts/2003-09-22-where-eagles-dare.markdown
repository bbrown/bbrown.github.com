<br />Awesome: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009N80R/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Where Eagles Dare</cite></a> is available on DVD! This is a great <acronym title="World War II">WWII</acronym> commando flick starring Clint Eastwood that you should definitely consider watching if you're a fan of any of the previous genres (WWII movies, commando movies, Clint Eastwood movies).<br /><br /><br />

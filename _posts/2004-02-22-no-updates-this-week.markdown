<br />I've got a pretty busy week planned, so there won't likely be any updates on bblog or <a href="/blogs/found/">Found on the Web</a>.<br /><br />I've got some ASP.NET training to attend from Monday through Wednesday at Microsoft's Phoenix office. It's kind of a refresher on the subject since we're getting ready to start our big project and I took the <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/in-training.cfm">Guerilla .NET training</a> way back in August 2003. It's a free seminar for Microsoft's enterprise customers, which we are in a big way. Since this is really important material, I will probably be quite focused and intent&#x2014;not good conditions for blogging.<br /><br />Thursday will find me back in the office, but swamped with a million things to do and a kajillion emails to wade through.<br /><br />I'm taking Friday off so that I can take <a href="/blogs/prego/">The Girls</a> in for their four-month-old series of vaccinations. Blogging while taking care of those little ones is all but impossible.<br /><br />So have a good week. There's lots of other stuff out there to read. If you're really hard up, may I suggest <a href="http://www.nobius.org/~dbg/practical-file-system-design.pdf"><cite>Practical File System Design</cite></a>?<br /><br /><br />

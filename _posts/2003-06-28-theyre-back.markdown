<br />After a nice weeklong respite, the <a href="2003_06_15_diamonds.cfm#200426689">asshat neighbors</a> are back full throttle. The patio cover looks nice, has been stucco'd, and is completely painted. All nice and done.<br /><br />Except that something now requires a circular saw and other power tools at 6:30 a.m. I'm trying to be a good neighbor and let it go, but could that level of inconsiderateness be any greater? I guess I'll just have to be the bigger man and avoid a feud that would certainly span generations.<br /><br /><br />

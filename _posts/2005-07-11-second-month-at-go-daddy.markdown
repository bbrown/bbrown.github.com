<br />Phew, work has been crazy! The powers-that-be (I have no idea who that might be) decided that they wanted the new product sooner than later so they're pursuing a more aggressive schedule and adding two more developers to the project, which has heretofore been just me. I had to complete two full use cases (four pages plus stored procedures) in just over a day in order to get caught up to the new project plan. I did it but it was a lot more rushed than I prefer. Still, it felt good to have accomplished it.<br /><br />I was initially nervous about getting some actual co-workers but one of them I had already developed a relationship with since we both had children that were 20 months old. Her son was born on October 31st and my girls were born on October 17th and 29th. We swapped war stories and pictures, so that was nice. Today I met the other guy on the team. He seems like a great guy and I found him quite amiable. Reading over his blog, I think we're going to have a lot of fun developing this brand new, details-not-available product.<br /><br />I was reviewing my code statistics today and I realized in the short month that I've been actively developing this new product, I've written 10,000 lines of code. It sure feels like it. I've also written increasingly complex stored procedures and very complex table joins. I know that I can do anything that I need to do, but it's nice to look back at what you've achieved in such a short amount of time.<br /><br />At any rate, this aggressive schedule means that I'll be able to do my own personal announcement sooner and I am <em>just dying</em> to let you people know exactly what I've been up to. It's easily the most exciting project I've ever been a part of and that includes a complete rewrite and rearchitecting of an online banking system (which was pretty damn exciting, let me tell you).<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

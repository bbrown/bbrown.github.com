<p>Dr. Pepper knock-off. A microbrew soda from a restaurant called <a href="http://www.fitzsbottlingco.com/">Fitzâ€™s</a> in St. Louis, MO. A little bit more cherry-flavored than Dr. Pepper and definitely lower in the flavor index than its more famous father.<br /><br /><strong>2 of 5 stars</strong></p>

<br /><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a> 4.5 has a new <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/ftp/pub/software/MacOSX/.sneakypeek/releases/">sneaky peek</a> out today&#x2014;finally!&#x2014;that incorporates the latest <a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/webcore/">WebCore</a> changes. It doesn't use WebKit, unfortunately, so it's still of normal download size. I couldn't discern any other wow-features though, just a bunch of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/ftp/pub/software/MacOSX/.sneakypeek/releases/OmniWeb-4.5sp-ReleaseNotes.html">bugfixes</a>.<br /><br /><br />

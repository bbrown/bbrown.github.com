<br /><a href="http://www.aynrand.org/objectivism/columbus.html">Columbus Day: A Time for Celebration</a>. I was going to write up a whole essay about how I think Columbus is not worth the vitriol that has been sent in his direction over the last decade, but I had an otherwise busy day and didn't get around to it. Perhaps next year.<br /><br />[UPDATE (10/15/03): Looks like <acronym title="American Indian Movement">AIM</acronym> is up to their <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Central/10/10/life.indians.reut/index.html">same old antics in Denver</a>.]<br /><br /><br />

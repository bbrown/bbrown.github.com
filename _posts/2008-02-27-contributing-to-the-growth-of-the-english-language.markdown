I think I just coined a new word today&#x2014;<strong>encomp</strong> (verb): the act of getting an application to match the comprehensive design provided by the designers. Usage: "Oh, I just got the slices from Andy so now it's time to start encomping."

I can't find any usages of it on Google, just confusion with encompassing. I claim this neologism then.

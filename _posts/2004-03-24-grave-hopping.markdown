<br />Today at lunch I found a <a href="http://www.maricopa.gov/parcelApplication/Assessor_query_detail.asp?ID=125-31-120-A&amp;info=res">cemetery</a>. The oddest damn thing about it is that it's directly across the street from my work. I've passed by it hundreds of times without ever noticing the headstones rising from its grounds.<br /><br />Intrigued, I found an opening in the chain link fence and walked around the plots. The oldest marker I found read 1877, while the newest was 1940. There were perhaps a dozen total with vaguely similar names and varying levels of ornate design. Of course, I was without my camera&#x2014;easily remedied in the future.<br /><br />On my next visit, I will dutifully copy down the markings on the gravestones and begin my research. This should be made much easier due to the recent Webification of <a href="http://genealogy.az.gov/">Arizona birth and death certificates</a>.<br /><br /><br />

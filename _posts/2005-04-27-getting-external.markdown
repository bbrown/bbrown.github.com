<br />I was going to buy a Mac Mini with some side money I've made lately, but I realized that what I really wanted the Mini for was a cheap backup and DVD burning system. It'd probably make more sense to buy a big hard drive and maybe an external DVD burner in the future.<br /><br />I'm looking at this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000117D9O/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/">FireWire LaCie 250GB</a>. It looks nice, the price is right, and the specs aren't half bad. Has anyone seen anything better for about the same price and about the same storage?<br /><br />[UPDATE (4/29/05): I went with that LaCie drive. I'll post if I find anything interesting about it.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />Ken Bereskin is finally updating <a href="http://bereskin.typepad.com/panther_weblog/">his blog</a> about neat features in Panther. He hasn't updated much this year after his self-announced goal of featuring all 150 new features of Jaguar, the last major release of Mac OS X. He's been going at it since <a href="http://bereskin.typepad.com/panther_weblog/2003/10/">October</a> and <a href="http://bereskin.typepad.com/panther_weblog/2003/11/">November</a>'s looking pretty good, too.<br /><br /><br />

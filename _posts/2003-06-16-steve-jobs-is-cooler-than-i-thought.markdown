<br />After reading this <a href="http://hbsworkingknowledge.hbs.edu/pubitem.jhtml?id=3533&amp;t=innovation">account of Steve Jobs</a> at the presentation of the Segway HT <em>n&#xE9;e</em> Ginger, I am even more impressed with him than I was before. That sort of take no crap, cut to the chase attitude is refreshing and just as I would have expected. Confirmation is a good thing. Some might say that he was rude or mean, but I see it as thoroughly vetting an idea that he regarded as problematic. They say at the end that such "energetic discussion" is good, but the <a href="http://www.segway.com/">results</a> don't seem to support any fruits of that exchange.<br /><br />When you get right down to it, the Segway isn't that revolutionary. <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/926145.asp">Some people</a> can hardly even ride it. The only thing that might even be revolutionary is the hype surrounding it and its sister invention, the drinking water thingy. It's practically a perpetual motion machine: a finite, limited amount of information generated a practically limitless amount of publicity with nearly zero loss. If Kamen could replicate that for companies, he could make another fortune just doing <acronym title="Public Relations">PR</acronym> work.<br /><br />[UPDATE: As usual, good <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/06/16/1828207&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=188&amp;tid=192">discussion</a> the article over at <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>.]<br /><br /><br />

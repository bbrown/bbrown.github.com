<br />If you're reading this within half an hour of posting (it's 5:53PM here in Phoenix), you might want to check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003XAMR/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>It Happened Here</cite></a> on <a href="http://www.turnerclassicmovies.com/ThisMonth/Article/0,,59882,00.html">Turner Classic Movies</a>. It's a <acronym title="World War II">WWII</acronym> movie based on the premise that the Nazis beat the Allies and it depicts life in postbellum England. I've never seen it, so I can't exactly recommend it. I am, however, going to TiVo it and watch it later. It reminds me of a book I read as a young adult entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345318099/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>SS-GB</cite></a> that had much the same premise.<br /><br />The movie brings up the topic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history">alternate history</a>, an apparently rich subset of history that has virtually no academic standing. It's almost like the rotisserie league of history and has thrived quite well on <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/History/Alternate_History/">the Web</a> and in <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=alternate+history&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search">Usenet</a>.<br /><br /><br />

<br /><a href="http://www.clamhead.com/">Keri</a>'s <a href="http://clamhead.com/wedding/">wedding site</a> is visually stunning. Having been married when the Web was just branching off of Gopher, we never got to do anything like this. Maybe I'll make something like this for <a href="/blogs/prego/">our daughters</a> births. Her site is at once simple and refined&#x2014;in a word, it's <em>designed</em>.<br /><br />Note: the markup is typical <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">Dreamweaver</a> bloatcode. That's why my layout never looks pixelly-perfect: I hate using tables for anything but the simplest layout. I've tried to use divs and spans, but it usually doesn't look good in a browser that I know someone is using. To put it bluntly, I'm not a designer. And that's okay, because I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and, doggone it, people like me. I'm just going to do the best Bill Brown Information Center I can.<br /><br />[UPDATE: I just realized that she was married <strong>in</strong> Disneyland. That's wild, wacky stuff.]<br /><br /><br />

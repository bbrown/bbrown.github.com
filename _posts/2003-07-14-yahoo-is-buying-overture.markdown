<br /><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/"><cite>The Register</cite></a> <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/7/31728.html">reports</a> that <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> is buying <a href="http://www.overture.com/">Overture</a> for $1.63 billion.<br /><br />Aside from the obvious Yahoo already uses Google for its search engine, this move is also interesting because Overture had previously purchased <a href="http://www.altavista.com/">AltaVista</a> and <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/">FAST</a> while Yahoo had recently purchased <a href="http://www.inktomi.com/">Inktomi</a>. That means that Yahoo's now got three owned search engines, one contractual search engine, and two additional portals. Integrating (and even sorting them out) is going to be a pain in the butt. However, they're now in a much firmer position <em>vis-&#xE0;-vis</em> Google than they ever have been since FAST is a good search engine&#x2014;I was never very impressed with Inktomi except in the beginning&#x2014;and Overture makes Google's ad revenue look like a pittance.<br /><br />A <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/14/1450222&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=187">Slashdot story</a> about this matter has just appeared. I'm sure there'll be some interesting discussion therein.<br /><br /><br />

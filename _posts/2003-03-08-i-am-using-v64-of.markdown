<br />I am using <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/safaribeta64.html">v64</a> of <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Apple's Safari browser</a> and I am completely stoked about the prospects of this browser! The "Open in Tabs" option in the bookmarks bar is straight from Opera and I think it's the best route to implement <a href="http://www.deftone.com/blogzilla/archives/bookmark_groups_ui.html">bookmark groups</a>.<br /><br />Think that I'm in some super elite beta testing cohort? Nope, I just know where to <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/downloads/" title="Shhh, don't tell anyone.">look</a>.<br /><br /><br />

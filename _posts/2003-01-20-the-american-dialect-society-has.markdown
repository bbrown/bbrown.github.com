<br />The <a href="http://www.americandialect.org/">American Dialect Society</a> has posted its <a href="http://www.americandialect.org/woty.html">Words of the Year 2002</a> list. The winner: weapons of mass destruction. Ugh. I have grown to completely hate this word. I have disliked it since my first encounter. It resounds of military euphemism while signifying nothing since it could encompass chemical, biological, nuclear, and even conventional weapons. I can't think of a more massive destruction wrought this century then the <a href="http://www.meredith.edu/stones/newpage2.htm">firestorms of Dresden</a> during World War II. What's the meaning of the word beyond "weapon"?<br /><br />Some of the other words were creative though without much chance of lasting. "Teen angstrel" meaning "angst-ridden popular singer." "Walking pinata" meaning "person subjected to relentless criticism." "201(k)" meaning a "401(k) ruined by stock losses." "Embetterment," apparently used by George Bush in a speech, reminds me a lot of the made-up Simpsons word "<a href="http://www.snpp.com/guides/jebediah.html">embiggen</a>."<br /><br /><br />

<p>
Today was the <a href="http://www.vnsabooksale.org/">annual VNSA book sale</a>. This year I went for quality over <a href="http://bbrown.info/2003/02/09/book-dealing-2.aspx">quantity</a>. I also made a pact with Sandi that I wasn't going to go crazy; I was only going to buy books that I would actually be reading instead of my usual rubric of "Well, you never know what you'll need and I won't be able to buy it for 50&#xA2; in that future."
</p>
<p>
I spent a total of $23.80, an all-time low on the following books:

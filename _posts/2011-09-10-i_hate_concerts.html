Concerts suck. I go to them to support the obscure musicians I enjoy but I don't relish the event like many do. The music often overpowers the singing, it's all too loud, and it's a crapshoot whether they'll play your favorites.

I'll take a recorded, constructed&mdash;hell, produced&mdash;track from a studio over the same any day of the week. That's why live albums absolutely mystify me.

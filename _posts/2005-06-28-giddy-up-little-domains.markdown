<br />Wow! At one point just before it became a domain registrar, <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">Go Daddy</a> was <a href="http://bobparsons.com/index.php?/archives/65-guid.html">located</a> in a house on an old ranch in Cave Creek. Another choice tidbit from that memoir: Bob Parsons contemplated becoming a "stick man on a craps table" or a valet. Luckily, business improved and it became a raging success.<br /><br />For me, the best piece of advice&#x2014;and I sometimes forget this&#x2014;was the following:<blockquote>I remembered something my father used to say. He said &#147;A smart dog chews his own bone.&#148; Basically, that meant to do what you know how to do. And for me that meant developing software or intellectual property.</blockquote><br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

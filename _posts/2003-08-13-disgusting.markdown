<br /><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/">WorldNet Daily</a> <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=34042">reports</a> that an official in the Department of Energy was awarded $13,000 after and $7,500 before sending an intelligence report to Congress detailing Iraq's nuclear weapons program <em>over the "objections of Energy's nuclear weapons research labs and senior members of his own staff."</em> The report was vital to the conclusion that Iraq had resuscitated its nuclear-weapons program because Energy is "viewed as the final arbiter of technical disputes regarding nuclear-proliferation issues."<br /><br />The $13,000 bonus was said to be for "exceeding performance expectations." Absolutely repulsive. I cannot believe some of the things I'm hearing. I voted for Bush in 2000&#x2014;I couldn't bring myself to vote for Al "Earth in the Balance" Gore even though I viewed Bush's compassionate conservatism as a milquetoasty socialism. I sure hope the Republican Party doesn't automatically nominate Bush in 2004 so that there might be some choice, but I doubt it.<br /><br />At the rate these allegations are coming up, I may have to seriously investigate <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/08/08/perot/index.html">Perot</a> if he runs. I couldn't vote for a Democrat again (I voted for Clinton in 1992 because I, in my youth, believed that Clinton would bring about the downfall of the Democrats better than George Bush. Actually, I can't remember exactly what I was thinking but that was the gist of it.) and Perot is seeming less and less crazy every day.<br /><br /><br />

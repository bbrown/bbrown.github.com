I once was an Inbox Zero fiend, but I've long since tempered that. <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/01/open-question-inbox-zero.html#comment-4893809">This comment</a> sums up my current attitude towards mail handling:

<blockquote>
I don't follow any particular fad, but I do try to keep my inboxes empty&mdash;if I leave a read message in an inbox, it's because the message is critical and I *want* to be annoyed by it so that I don't forget (e.g. bill due today, meeting reminder, etc.).

In related news, I've installed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/quotefixformac/">this plugin</a> to Mail.app to save myself some time when doing <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/01/interleaved-email/">interleaved replies</a>.

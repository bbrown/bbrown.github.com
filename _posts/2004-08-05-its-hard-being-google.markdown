<br />Here's an interesting presentation entitled <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/Workshops/searchandcollaboration2004/papers/haifa.pdf">"Challenges in Running a Commercial Search Engine"</a> by <a href="http://singhal.info/">Amit Singhal</a>, Google Senior Research Scientist. It's a 3.2MB <acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym>. It's a fascinating synopsis of the current state of the disgusting spectacle that is search engine optimization.<br /><br />I delete about 50 comment spams at a time on this site and I check it several times a day so as to rob them of any value they're seeking. Nothing can stop them; I've given up blocking their IP addresses. If Google can solve this problem, then the incentive for comment (and other forms of) spam disappears.<br /><br />Keep up the good work, Google!<br /><br /><br />

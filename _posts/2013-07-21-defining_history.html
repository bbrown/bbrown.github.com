I realized after listening to <a href="http://powellhistory.wordpress.com/2013/07/19/history-is-dead-long-live-history-the-interview/" title="It's a grueling interview: I've never heard anyone ever overemote to that degree.">Scott Powell's interview about history</a> that my own definition of history was <a href="http://bbrown.info/2002/09/im-currently-procrastinating-on-a.html" title="I had completely forgotten I had ever even set it down.">buried</a> on this site. <a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/definitions.html" title="Ayn Rand has such a unique perspective on epistemological issues.">Definitions</a> are vital because they delimit one's study and serve the need for clarity.
</p>
<blockquote>
History is the study of the human past with the end of understanding the present.
</blockquote>
<p>
It occurred to me, upon reflection, that I should perhaps append "and future" to the definition. This is basically what Powell suggests the purpose of history is&mdash;to "instruction, inspiration, and insight." But I'm not so sure.
</p>
<p>
History, per se, doesn't offer guidance about how to live, how to effect cultural change, or how to organize society. Those are the province of philosophy. History as a subject amasses data about the course of humanity. History as a discipline creates the tools for inferring what has transpired from what is available to us now.
</p>
<p>
This knowing where we are and how we got there is vital. History provides the context of the present. To expect of it the task of philosophy is misguided; history is the fodder&mdash;a broad, wide-ranging set of concretes&mdash;that allows us to induce philosophic principles.
</p>
<p>
That being said, the purpose of any particular person for studying history should be exactly what Powell indicated. However, historians should not do that work for their readers: they should focus on accurately laying out the facts with minimal interpretation and instruction. Otherwise historical accounts become mere pabulum like Howard Zinn's <cite>A People's History of the United States</cite>.

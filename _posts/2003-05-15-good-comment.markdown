<br />I just made a <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000200.php#bill_brown_004596">good comment</a> about a <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000200.php">post</a> in the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise blog</a>. I'd repost it here, but you should really see in its original context.<br /><br /><br />

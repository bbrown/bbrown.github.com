One of the many things that having children has taught me is that English is a very difficult language. If they weren't totally immersed in it from birth, I don't know how you'd learn it. (As an aside, I have a lot of respect for anyone that picks English up as a second language.)

A favorite quirk of mine is how pronunciations change wildly and seemingly for no reason. For example:
</p>
<table width="400" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="margin:10px auto;">
<tr>
	<td width="75">Life</td>
	<td width="325">the thing we only have one of (hard "i")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Live</td>
	<td>what we do with that (short "i")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Live</td>
	<td>from New York, it's Saturday Night (long "i")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Lives</td>
	<td>the present participle (short "i")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Lives</td>
	<td>two or more (long "i")</td>
</tr>
</table>

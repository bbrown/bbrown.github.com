<br />I'm watching <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/">Late Night with Conan O'Brien</a> right now. There's a pre-recorded sketch where Conan takes pity on the people waiting in line in the freezing cold on standby to attend the show. So he rents an RV, invites a bunch of them in, and holds a show in there while they drive around New York City.<br /><br />What a hilarious concept! He's got Max Weinberg playing drums using pots and pans and Joel Godard announcing. They essentially duplicated the opening, monologue and all. Finally, Conan's celebrity guest was MC Hammer. He had MC Hammer dancing alongside him to some 60s music. It was masterfully done and totally entertaining.<br /><br /><br />

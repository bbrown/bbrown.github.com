<br />Regular readers of this blog (Hey <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/">Steve</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>!) know that I am truly a <a href="http://www.google.com/googlefriends/apr1998.html">Google Friend</a> and avidly follow any <a href="http://google.blogspace.com/">news</a> of <a href="/values/places/google.cfm">my favorite search engine</a>.<br /><br />Happily, I stumbled across an <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P325_0_1_0_C">interview with Google's CEO Eric Schmidt</a> [parts <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P328_0_1_0_C">two</a>, <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P331_0_1_0_C">three</a>, and <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P333_0_1_0_C">four</a>]. I'll admit that I was very skeptical back when Schmidt was hired. Coming from <a href="http://www.novell.com/">Novell</a>, he seemed like the very last person to lead a rag-tag bunch of computer scientists at the <a href="http://www.google.com/plex/">Googleplex</a>. He comes across very well in the interview and seems to really understand his and Google's place in the wider Web.<br /><br />In light of my earlier entry, I think the thing that most excited me was the reminder that the job-creation engine has moved into the small business market and that the "barrier to entry for a small business entrepreneur has dropped by an order of magnitude or more."<br /><br /><br />

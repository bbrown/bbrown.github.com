<p>What?! <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/mar06/03-21WindowsVistaDeliveryPR.mspx">Windows Vista is delayed again</a>? This time <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2006/03/vista-2007-fire-leadership-now.html">past the invaluable Christmas buying spree</a>? The hell you say! It just can't be because XP was released in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=windows%20xp%20release%20date">October 2001</a> and no major operating system developer would go 5&#xBD; years between releases, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_history#Releases">would they</a>?</p>

<br /><a href="http://www.goodlogo.com/top250?interval=1">Top 250 logos</a> as rated by readers over at goodlogo!com. This is interesting to me because <a href="http://www.desertschools.org/">my employer</a> just settled on a new logo. I'm not sure how much I like the new one (which I can't unveil just yet) but it's a far sight better than the current one. (The site also pointed out the arrow in the <a href="http://www.fedex.com/">FedEx</a> logo that I had never seen before: it's in the negative space created by the "E" and the "x" below the baseline. Way cool!)<br /><br /><br />

<br />I'm standing here in line near the Apple Store at Biltmore Fashion Park waiting for who knows what. There is probably 200 people ahead of me in line. This is all part of some Mac OS X 10.2 hoopla. Since I've already got 10.2 installed (it came via upgraded delivery today instead of tomorrow), I can only chalk this up to general insanity.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I'm 80 pages into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596002815/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Learning Python</cite></a> in my quest to Python proficiency so I can try on some <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> for size. So far, the book seems great: comprehensive, thoughtful, and well-written. The language&#x2014;I'm only up to strings&#x2014;reminds me a bit too much of VBScript in its simplicity. I'm sure that my view will change when I start getting into the object-oriented sections, but right now it seems pretty BASIC. *pun intended*<br /><br /><br />

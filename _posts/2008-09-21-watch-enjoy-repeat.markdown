<cite>The A.V. Club</cite> had a <a href="http://www.avclub.com/content/feature/avq_a_most_rewatched_movies">feature</a> asking a bunch of people I've never heard of the question "what's your most-rewatched movie?" Their responses were interesting&#x2014;and would be more so if I were familiar with the individuals&#x2014;so I thought I'd share my answer.

I've thought about the subject a lot because my <em>favorite</em> movies aren't necessarily the ones I watch regularly. It's a crucial distinction because there are several movies that I don't think are good or great by any stretch but I enjoy watching a lot. My favorite movies aren't necessarily those that I can (or do) watch regularly but they really resonate with me whenever I do.

My all-time most re-watched movie has to be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009X760U/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Happy Gilmore</cite></a>, which I think most people who know me would be surprised to find out. I watch this at least once a month and sometimes more, I can quote from it liberally and extensively. My favorite scenes are definitely the ones with Ben Stiller as a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116483/quotes#qt0242634">nursing home orderly</a>. It makes me laugh every time.

Aside from that, I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000B1OFL/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>The Italian Job</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0780618556/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Dumb and Dumber</cite></a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006AL1E/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Back to the Future</cite></a>. I must say that <a href="http://www.6browns.com/2008/01/tv-simplified/">getting rid of satellite</a> and the <a href="http://www.netflix.com/BeMyFriend/POgQBXgWBWiBKyVpf1Fq">three-at-a-time plan from Netflix</a> have cut into the time I have to re-watch movies: I could have made a much more extensive list two years ago, for example.

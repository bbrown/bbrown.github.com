<p>
In the spirit of Matthew Baldwin's <a href="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/archives/001881.html">Clich&#xE9; Rotation Project</a>, I offer the following:
</p>
<table width="400" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top;">"can't see the forest for the trees"</td>
<td>
"can't see the directory for the files"<br />
"can't see the array for the items"<br />
"can't see the site for the pages"<br />
"can't see the byte for the bits"
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top;">"take it with a grain of salt"</td>
<td>
"take it with a check of Snopes"
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
I'll add to this list as they come to me.
</p>

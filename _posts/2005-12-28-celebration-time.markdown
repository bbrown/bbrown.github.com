<p>I just realized that I didn't blog about the <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/051228/law011.html">recent Go Daddy holiday celebration</a>. It took place on December 15th at the <a href="http://www.camelbackinn.com/">Camelback Inn</a>, where, sadly, my last three or four annual company parties have been—though I was able to compare the events because of it.</p><p>We
got to the party about a half hour before it was slated to begin and
were given two tickets each for drinks. Since we were so early, there
was hardly anyone there and the waiters outnumbered the employees for
awhile. That was good for me because that meant that I was offered hors
d'oeuvres constantly. They were quite delicious little appetizers and I
never refused one of them.</p><p>Once seated, we were served a
quite-tasty seafood Waldorf salad as an appetizer. Dinner consisted of
chicken, tender steak, creamy mashed potatoes, and butter-slathered
vegetables. There wasn't nearly enough of it, but it was a savory.
Dessert was a simple crème brûlée with blueberries. The food was
top-notch and quite an improvement over past events, which were great
to begin with.</p><p>The
highlight of the evening—at least for me since I didn't win squat—was
Bob's rousing speech. He ran through the accomplishments of the last
year in quick (and often deprecating) fashion. Any employee who had
witnessed the quarterly speeches had heard this list several times, but
the employee's guest hadn't and Bob's delivery made it entertaining.
Bob then ran through a hilarious and farcical presentation of ten
possible commercials for the next Super Bowl. The crowd was in
stitches. Having sat through about eight or nine presidential speeches
at company dinners where you wanted to shove bits of roll into your
ears to make the dreary blather stop, this speech went quickly and hit
home.</p><p>The most exciting part of the evening was the door prize
giveaway. I had heard from my co-worker that plasma televisions were
bestowed and I was salivating at the prospect. Little did I know that
the prize level was going to be ratcheted up. Bob drew names from the
whole of the company and gave away:</p><ul><li>Two 42" plasma TVs</li><li>Two 23" plasma televisions</li><li>Two Bose stereo systems</li><li>Two digital cameras (I didn't catch the details)</li><li>One digital camcorder (again, didn't catch the brand)</li><li>Four iPod Nanos</li><li>One 60GB iPod Video</li><li>Two $500 Costco gift certificates</li><li>Two $500 Westcor gift certificates</li><li>Two $500 Best Buy gift certificates</li><li>Two flat screen monitors (19", I think)</li><li>One HP laptop</li><li>One portable DVD player</li><li>Twenty $100 American Express gift cards</li><li>Forty people got $500 in cash with taxes paid</li><li>Ten people got $1,000 in cash with taxes paid</li><li>Four people got $2,500 in cash with taxes paid</li><li>Two people got $5,000 in cash with taxes paid</li><li>One person got $10,000 in cash with taxes paid</li></ul><p></p><p>Those
are some serious door prizes and the excitement in the room was
palpable. All in all, the event was memorable though not at all unusual
by Go Daddy standards. It was truly Go Daddy-esque in the best sense of
the word.</p><p style="font-size:xx-small;">[The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]</p>

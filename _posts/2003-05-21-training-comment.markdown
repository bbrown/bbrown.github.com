<br />My trainer is in his own little world. He's completely abandoned any pretext of guided instruction and started writing code at the pace you would do during development. He's copying and pasting with wild abandon and flipping between source files looking for pieces of data while muttering inaudibly about what he's looking for. He's also completely forgotten that we may not have caught up to where he is.<br /><br />The perils of pedagogy&#x2014;or, more properly, the perils of non-pedagogy.<br /><br /><br />

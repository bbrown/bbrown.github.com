<br />I had my <a href="/writings/html/oconnor.cfm">review of <cite>The Map of Innovation</cite></a> published on <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/30/019257&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=98&amp;tid=99">Slashdot</a> yesterday. If you're here because of that, welcome and thanks for visiting!<br /><br />The ensuing discussion is not at all what I had hoped. I was disappointed at the level of discourse and its focus. Most of the messages were about the dot-com foolishness, a few were about Kevin O'Connor, and the rest were about how "technology is important" was a prosaic message for a book.<br /><br />I was not expecting that. I reviewed the book because I thought Slashdotters would be interested in starting up their own ventures. I figured that we could have a productive discussion about practical issues of entrepreneurship, ideas for new businesses, and thoughts about innovation. I guess I was expecting too much. Those are the sorts of things that get my juices flowing.<br /><br />Only one <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=80470&amp;cid=7118311">commenter</a> shared my sentiments. It's a lonely place, that Slashdot.<br /><br /><br />

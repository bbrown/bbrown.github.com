<br />I'm packing for my trip to Torrance, California right now and just about ready to head off for the short hop to <acronym title="Los Angeles International Airport">LAX</acronym>. I'm not entirely sure what my connectivity will be like in the Hilton Torrance-South Bay, but the worst case is that my employer pays for me to dial up to my Phoenix-based ISP.<br /><br />Probably no updates tonight.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I like <a href="http://www.kk.org/">Kevin Kelly</a>'s new idea of a <a href="http://www.kk.org/recomendo/">recommendations blog</a>. It's not a new idea, but I think it's new to aggregate and focus on them. I wonder if a <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">MetaFilter</a>-style incarnation would devolve into <a href="http://www.epinions.com/">ePinions</a> or be hijacked by commercial interests.<br /><br />It seems like taking it out of the context of one man's favorites would get more content faster. Kevin Kelly's only one man and he <a href="http://www.kk.org/helpwanted/index.php">appears</a> to be a busy man at that.<br /><br /><br />

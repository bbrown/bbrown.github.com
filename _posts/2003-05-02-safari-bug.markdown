<br />I just found a whopper of a <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> bug that reveals your <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/technologies/security.html" title="Great feature, by the way">Keychain</a> password in the address bar in plaintext. I don't know if that makes it programmatically accessible, but I still don't see why it would be there at all! I'm sending a bug report to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> crew. I would show you the screen shot I sent them, except that that would require compromising my entire system security. Thank you, but no.<br /><br /><br />

<br />Looks like the minor outage is over. From the logs, it appears to have lasted from 5:00ish to 11:00ish! If I had to pay for my hosting, I'd be pissed. As it stands, I just think about how gracious my <a href="http://www.defrane.com/">host</a> has been. Once I get my side project off the ground and start paying, then I'm going to want better uptime. But for now, I can live with such things.<br /><br /><br />

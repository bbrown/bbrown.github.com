<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx">Wow</a>. Microsoft will bundle the <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> library with all ASP.NET MVC projects, enhance its interaction with Visual Studio through IntelliSense, use it in future ASP.NET Ajax controls, and <em>provide support for the library itself</em>. This is huge because most of the Microsoft universe doesn't take note of anything not provided by Microsoft in a standard distribution.

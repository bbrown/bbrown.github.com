<br /><a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/">Steve</a> turned me on to <a href="http://www.redvsblue.com/">Red vs. Blue</a>, an online sitcom. Online sitcom? I know, that's so late 90s but this one's different. The people responsible used the characters in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/xbox/">Xbox</a> game <a href="http://halo.bungie.org/">Halo</a> as their actors and did the voice-overs themselves. I've seen this concept before and it wasn't particularly well done: something was usually off, either the dialog sounded wrong (read: out of character) or the animation was sketchy. These guys, however, look like they've put a lot of thought into the endeavor: it's obviously scripted and storyboarded with interesting camera angles and witty dialogue that is completely consistent with what guys stuck in some out-of-the-way military outpost would say.<br /><br />They produce one a week and there is currently nine available. There is some profanity, but you're not going to let that stop you. Enjoy! (Their <a href="http://www.redvsblue.com/faq.shtml"><acronym title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</acronym></a> is hilarious as well.)<br /><br /><br />

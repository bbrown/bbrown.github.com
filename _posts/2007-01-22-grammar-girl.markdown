I discovered <a href="http://grammar.qdnow.com/">Grammar Girl</a> awhile ago but thought nothing more of her at the time than "Oh, she's using Quick Blog." Then a co-worker brought <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/internet/01/22/grammar.girl/index.html">this CNN article</a> to my attention and I realized that she's actually quite popular.

<p>
I don't know why but it's always astounding to me when I find a Quick Blog being popular or being used by someone high-profile. I shouldn't be surprised&#x2014;it is a quality product after all&#x2014;but I can't help it.

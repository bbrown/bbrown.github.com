I'm a sucker for time-lapse sequences. Maybe it's my inner historian, but I love seeing the effects of time without taking a lot of it. I can still <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/archives/2006/09/its-a-gettin-closer">remember</a> the day when I first encountered <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B26asyGKDo">Noah Kalina's pioneering 6-year daily photo montage</a>: I contemplated starting down that road myself but I quickly realized that I didn't particularly care to put forth the effort. I forgot about the genre until about an hour ago.
</p>
<p>
It was then that I caught <a href="http://www.waxy.org/">Andy Baio</a> link to <a href="http://www.danhanna.com/aging_project/p.html">Dan Hanna's Photo Aging Project</a> wherein he took two photos a day for <em>17 years</em>:

HOLY CRAP! That's some forethought and work. I was impressed. And so I started looking for similar, though less-formidable, videos. Boy did I find them!
</p>
<p>
[Programming note: I'm really torn between just providing links to the videos and actually embedding them inline. If I put them inline, then this is going to be one slow loading and long-ass entry. But if I just link to the video, then you're going to be a-clicking all day. I wonder which one I'll choose.]
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKzt8970r9I">Ines Everyday</a>: this is the one that got me interested in looking further into this. I guess it had seemed previously like a male thing and this made me realize that there was probably a bunch of interesting characters doing these videos. Main takeaways: she changes her hairstyle a lot and seems to enjoy covering her neck.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55YYaJIrmzo">Girl takes pic of herself every day for three years</a>: a solid entry by an Asian lady. Main takeaway: she went through a lot of glasses in three years.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02e5EWUP5TE">She takes a photo every day</a>: the 200-day entry in an ongoing project. Main takeaways: she <em>really</em> changes her hairstyle a lot, has a lot of earrings, and was that mime makeup? <a href="http://clickflashwhirr.blogspot.com/">Yes, it was</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=henv2naXuGo">Growing a beard</a>: well-done piece. Main takeaway: he's a slow beard grower. My friend Larry could have made that video in a week tops.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Q6BJA7siI">Ellora Daily Photo reaches 1282</a>: photos from birth on of a little girl. Main takeaway: I wonder what happened that required her head to be shaved on day 915.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU6ojtBW0Qo">9 months of gestation in 20 seconds</a>: it's like watching a bell curve form. Main takeaway: the guy behind it is quite a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EgzTd8jYaM" title="Talk about painful to watch.">goober</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVJfP7tCRZQ">Madeline, Five Years - Photo a Day</a>: nice try, but 198 photos is not "Photo a Day." Still, pretty adorable.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQxOu_VEghY">Lee takes a photo of himself every day for three years</a>: nothing special until 50 seconds in. Yowza!
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RxrT8LjTH0">Michael takes a photo of himself every day for 1 year</a>: teenage boy going from 16 to 17. Main takeaways: lots of hairstyles and why would anyone have that clown picture on their wall.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL7qLxXky2A">Puppy Photo Everyday</a>: Labrador going from 7 weeks to 6 months and completely busting the "Everyday" claim. Still, it's a puppy. Come on!
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsahbQx-wek">Amanda takes a photo of herself every day for 2 years</a>: watch the transformation from 14 to 16. She's going to really appreciate this when she's older.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ2y_07IcAQ">Ryan takes a photo of himself every day for 400 days</a>: a black guy takes on the project. Main takeaway: what's the deal with the purple hair at 23 seconds in?!
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f4Hi2cjuhw">Sven takes a picture of himself everyday for 3 years</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPxMbVMJDY4">Tobias takes a picture of himself everyday for 3 years</a>: twin brothers from 27 to 30. Is it wrong that I only watched one?
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://vimeo.com/106228">Living My Life Faster - 8 years of JK's Daily Photo Project</a>: high quality with much better stabilization. He's also got <a href="http://www.c71123.com/daily_photo/">the pictures</a> if the video wasn't enough.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I left off the countless parodies, which were often funny. I think they're strangely compelling because the subjects are real people&#x2014;not a seedling, for example&#x2014;and they have the nostalgic appeal of a yearbook with the intervening, gradual tweening that's normally missing.

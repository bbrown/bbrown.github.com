<br />Like <a href="http://www.appleturns.com/scene/?id=4015">Jack Miller</a>, I am super excited about the <acronym title="WorldWide Developer's Conference">WWDC</acronym> Keynote given by His Steveness. I was especially excited after reading <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2003/06/20030616171618.shtml">this report from MacRumors</a>. Note the translated text in the Apply Germany invitation: "Expect some news that will exceed all your past expecation [regarding speed]s" and "Be ready for a new computer era." It'll be (maybe) the first time I've looked forward to a Monday.<br /><br /><br />

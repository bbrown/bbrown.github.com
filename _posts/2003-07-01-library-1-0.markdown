<br />In other software news, I purchased a license for ArcaneWare's <a href="http://www.arcaneware.com/library/">Library</a> 1.0 yesterday after a quick preview. I've considered options like <a href="http://www.readerware.com/">ReaderWare</a> and <a href="http://www.wickedlysimple.com/BookTracker/index.html">BookTracker</a>, but they were either too powerful or too difficult to add books to respectively.<br /><br />Library has an Amazon lookup by ISBN, bookmarking feature, and lending status indicator as well as general filtering and text export. It's not everything I want, but it could be with further development&#x2014;something I want to encourage by paying the $10 registration fee.<br /><br />If you want to keep track of a large library (mine's several thousand books strong and I've tediously entered only 57), but you don't want to pay $40 for ReaderWare or like Cocoa-styled, OS X-native apps you should really check this program out.<br /><br /><br />

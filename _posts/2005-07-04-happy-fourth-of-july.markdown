<br />Happy Independence Day! I could write a paean to America and the American way of life, but I won't. If you're interested in some vaguely Independence-Day&#x2013;themed content, may I suggest my essay <a href="/writings/html/jefferson.cfm">"Thomas Jefferson, Abolitionist"</a>?<br /><br /><br />

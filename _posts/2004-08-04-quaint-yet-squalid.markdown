<br />I like finding culinary diamonds in the rough&#x2014;quaint little places that have solid, delicious fare at good values without being the talk of the town. In this, I know that I am not unusual. What I sometimes forget is that though quaint starts the same as quality, it doesn't always mean quality.<br /><br />Take, for example, my recent discovery of Sushi Mishima off Thomas and 56th Street in Phoenix. It's run by a lady and her husband: she does the waitressing and he does the cooking. Each meal is a series of courses: first soup, then salad, then entr&#xE9;e, and topped off with a fruit dessert. I've never spent more than $10 on a meal, including the tip. My favorite dish is the grilled albacore tuna steak though their sushi wasn't bad either.<br /><br />I tell <a href="/values/people/sandibrown.cfm">Sandi</a> about these expeditions and she takes it just like she does with my non-culinary expeditions: with a roll of the eye and an admonition to be careful. This time she suggested I check the food inspection reports for this Japanese dive and I thought, "Ha! I'm going to prove her wrong and show her that appearances can deceive."<br /><br />After a number of tries at getting the name right, I found the <a href="http://envquery.maricopa.gov/envscrp/pbisa70.dll/emsservr/uo_emsserver/f_perm_inspection_results?as_cat=4&amp;al_perm_id=51636">report</a>. Sweet sassy molassy! They've had repeated major violations and the best score they've received was a 33. And I'm ingesting raw fish from these people! It also helped to explain why they were closed for a couple of weeks for a "vacation": the county <a href="http://envquery.maricopa.gov/envscrp/pbisa70.dll/emsservr/uo_emsserver/f_insp_violations_results?al_insp_id=802931">shut them down</a>! I'm not inclined to exclamation points, but this merits them.<br /><br />I guess sometimes there's a reason they're in the rough and I guess they're sometimes actually cubic zirconia.<br /><br /><br />

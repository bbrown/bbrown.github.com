<br />I totally called it. Today's <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/">DaveNet</a> essay&#x2014;<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2003/02/20/commentsOnTheGooglebloggerDeal">Comments on the Google-Blogger deal</a>&#x2014;is rife with self-serving comments ("... the blogging developer community was founded, in 1996 or 1999 depending on whose histories you read or believe."), petulant pouting ("Every so often a major company would come for a visit ... and we never heard the question from Google, even though we know their investors and a few of the execs at Google. They bought Blogger, apparently, without talking to the field of competitors."), and stunning self-promotion ("However, Google will find this is already a competitive market, UserLand already offers a deeper product...."). It's quintessential Dave and it sickens me.<br /><br /><br />

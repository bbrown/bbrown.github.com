<br />Chip and Reichen won on <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race4/">The Amazing Race</a> and the race terminated in Phoenix! They visited the anchor of the U.S.S. Arizona right near the Capitol, Sun Devil Stadium, and finished at <a href="/values/places/papagopark.cfm">Papago Park</a>!<br /><br />The actual finish stage was located in the part of the park that I frequent. I've walked the path they took a hundred times. It looks like it was a rainy day the day they filmed it, so that would explain why I wasn't there. The fact that it ended there is thrilling in a strange way, an intimate setting in my life is being showcased on national TV.<br /><br /><br />

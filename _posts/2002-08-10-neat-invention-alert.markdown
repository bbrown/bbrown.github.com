<br />Neat Invention Alert: the <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/786016.asp">Hypersonic Sound System</a> broadcasts sound in a tight narrow beam that only those in the path of that beam can hear. And no one else. Think of it as a speaker that acts like headphones. This is heady stuff and really reminds me of the personalized advertisements in <cite>Minority Report</cite>.<br /><br />The article discusses some of the applications including military uses to deafen the enemy. I could also see this enabling custom settings in movie viewing and just about any other use where headphones are currently used.<br /><br /><br />

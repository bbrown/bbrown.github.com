<br /><a href="http://prismicspiral.com/scribe/">Scribe</a>: a Firefox extension that allows you to save form fields, such as a blog entry post, as a local file. As someone who has lost at least a dozen blog entries due to application crashes, careless browsing, or accidental closing, this is a valuable extension.<br /><br />Well, except that <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a> (my primary home browsing environment) has had this since version 5 came out. Actually, it's much more robust than this since it saves everything when it crashes: from your form field text to your open tabs to each tab's history and contemporaneous content (a lifesaver in the case of <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> when you're in the middle of reading new entries in a folder full of feeds).<br /><br />[UPDATE: As if tempting the Fates, my battery went dead today in my iBook. OmniWeb did a valiant job at restoring what it could of a brilliant entry but it had only stored the first few sentences of the several paragraphs I had written. Moral of the story: nothing can protect against sudden power loss (except maybe a <acronym title="Uninterruptible Power Supply">APS.]<br /><br /><br />

<br /><a href="http://brian.carnell.com/">Brian Carnell</a> was in Michigan recently and <a href="http://brian.carnell.com/articles/2004/02/000016.html">chronicled</a> what happens when <a href="http://cantrip.org/stupidity.html">stupid people</a> start making protest signs.<br /><br />(Side note to Brian: I notice the URL for this story is of the format /year/month/000000.html. Do you really foresee writing more than 99,999 articles in one month? That's optimistic.]<br /><br /><br />

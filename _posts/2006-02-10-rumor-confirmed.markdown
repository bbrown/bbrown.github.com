<p>Think Secret is posting a rumor about a <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0602videoipod.html">brand new iPod Video</a> coming out April 1st. I can officially confirm it. How, you ask? Well, the 60 GB iPod Video I bought just arrived last night. There you go; you can take that to the bank.</p>

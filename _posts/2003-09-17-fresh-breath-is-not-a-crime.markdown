<br />My wife, a third-grade teacher, told me yesterday about how her principal was suspending a sixth grader for spraying cinnamon Binaca in ten kids' mouths at recess. She was also trying to decide whether to call the police and get a police report. For Binaca. Apparently, this is akin to drug dealing for her. This is pretty bad stuff, but it's compounded by the fact that a sixth grader last year was caught with a marijuana cigarette behind his ear and got off with the equivalent of a note home to his parents. No suspension, no police.<br /><br />She normally avoids any sort of confrontation with parents, but I expect that this one's going to blow up in her face in a big way.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I'm doing a final sprint this weekend to complete the project by Monday. I'm going to work a regular shift during the day, work from home tonight, and then work whatever it takes tomorrow to get the thing done. The more and more I work on this app, the more convinced that it's destined for greatness. The first release will should give a solid impression and each successive release will only strengthen it.<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />I've encountered lots of <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Issues_and_Causes/Poverty/Panhandling/E_Panhandling/">online begging</a>, but I've never seen a request as shameless as <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/09/03#When:4:22:34AM">this one</a>. He actually thinks that getting an increased ranking on <a href="http://www.daypop.com/">Daypop</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>, or <a href="http://www.feedster.com/">Feedster</a> is going to heighten awareness in the Presidential campaign headquarters of the candidates? Or is he being disingenuous about why he wants all the linkage? Winer wouldn't do that, would he?<br /><br />[UPDATE: And the sheep <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/09/04#When:7:53:13AM">respond</a>. How unfortunate.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 2: Contrast above with <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2001/04/11">this</a>. Which is it, minds or sheep?]<br /><br />[UPDATE 3: <a href="http://eod.com/devil/archive/">Zing!</a>]<br /><br /><br />

<br />Since everyone's been doing it lately, here's the places I've been (in red):<img src="http://www.world66.com/myworld66/visitedStates/statemap?visited=ALAZCANVORUT" align="center" style="margin:10px;" /><br />If you think that Alabama was an aberration, you'd be right. I "visited" there when I was about 12 to attend <a href="http://www.spacecamp.com/">Space Camp</a>. I've also "visited" Washington and Atlanta in the sense that I've been in their airports.<br /><br /><br />

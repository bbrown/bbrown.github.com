<h2>A Literature Review</h2>
<p>
The massive savings and loan failures of the late eighties and early
nineties did not go unnoticed. Thousands of pages of testimony at
congressional hearings have been published. Newspapers have published
chronologies, accounts of local S&amp;L failures, and anecdotes of senior
citizens losing their savings. Numerous books have been written with
titles like <cite>Who Robbed America?</cite>, <cite>S&amp;L Hell</cite>,
and <cite>The Greatest-Ever Bank Robbery</cite>. These journalistic
commentaries tend to either be strictly factual accounts or moralistic,
strident attacks on politicians and bankers. Both of these varieties tend
to examine the deep issues raised by the crisis on a very superficial
level, often leaping to unwarranted conclusions and unjust accusation.
While they make for vivacious reading, they tend to obfuscate more than
elucidate. A fuller analysis of the crisis is missing, perhaps because
such an analysis lacks the sensational headlines of the moralizing
condemnation or the convenient skimming of the factual chronology.
Unfortunately, both fail to provide the reader with any meaningful context
for a true understanding and a grounds from which to make judgments about
those people involved.
</p>
<p>
The academic world generally does not suffer from such failings. The
contrast between academic and non-academic accounts sometimes reveals that
the non-academic perspectives have everything absolutely wrong. There are
several reasons for this discrepancy: better training on the part of the
academics, different audiences, and lack of hard-and-fast deadlines. The
best writing combines the academic's rigor with the journalist's lively
style. The challenge for either group was writing about an economy-shaking
event while that event was still transpiring. Contemporary histories
frequently lack the objectivity that comes with temporal distance.
Important causal agents only become obvious after the fact, and available
to only a few astute observers during the catastrophe. Academic writers
tend to wait longer to compose their treatises on contemporary events and
thus tend to be more rigorous in their evaluation than journalists writing
while the iron is hot.
</p>
<p>
For these and other reasons, only a few good books and a handful of
articles have been written on the subject. The S&amp;L crisis was not as
devastating as the Great Depression or as unique as the Civil War, but it
did have a serious impact on the body politic and the economy at the time
and we are still experiencing some of the aftershocks today. One must
wonder at the dearth of academic material on what many regard as a
meaningful end to one of the most prosperous decades in American history.
The academic treatments also tend to be very specialized. They focused on
either the political or the economic side of the crisis. Whichever
perspective they adopt, they ignore&mdash;or superficially treat&mdash;the
other. While this may enable them to hone in on specific insights by
forestalling the inevitable questions, it certainly does not help the
reader to understand the broader issues involved. In fact, the
specialist's myopia may be counterproductive since it blinds the writer to
facts in other fields that might illuminate&mdash;or even contradict&mdash;his
or her conclusions. Ultimately, reality is multifaceted and
simultaneous&mdash;though it may be useful to occasionally separate out
aspects of an event for consideration by various disciplines, one can only
obtain a full understanding through exploration of an issue from all
appropriate angles.
</p>
<p>
This historiography will explore the literature on the savings and loan
crisis. As noted earlier, much has been written about this episode in
American history. First, we will give a brief account of the crisis and
the history that preceded it because an establishment of context is vital
before we can examine and evaluate what has been written about the crisis,
the next section of the literature review. Once we have critically
assessed the existing works, we can then list their deficiencies and
sketch remedies for those. These remedies can only be suggestions, due to
the limitations imposed by this paper's focus. However, those remedies
could easily serve as the foundation for a separate essay.
</p>
<p>
The savings and loan industry as we know it today came into existence in
the 1930s during the Great Depression. However, they had already been in
existence for one hundred years by that time. The first savings and loan
association was founded on January 3, 1831 in Frankford, Pennsylvania. It
was designed to enable its depositors to purchase homes, one by one, as
funds became available.<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a> That purpose would later become
its mandate, as the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932 enshrined promotion
of home ownership as the primary <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em> for the
savings and loans. The period in between these two critical events is
replete with S&amp;Ls struggling to remain relevant in the economy and
combat competition. S&amp;Ls in the mid-nineteenth century were an
exclusively local phenomena. A group of citizens would pool their money
and distribute loans to each member in turn. They were non-professional
financial institutions but they served a definite purpose and a crucial
need, since commercial banks typically would not lend to the poor or
recent immigrants. In the 1880s, though, a number of S&amp;Ls had higher
aspirations and sought to operate nationally through branch offices and
deposits by mail. The local S&amp;Ls could not compete with the national
ones and so sought state bans on national savings and loan institutions
through the formation of the United States League of Local Building and
Loan Associations&mdash;the precursor to the powerful United States League
of Savings Institutions.<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a>
</p>
<p>
Thus began a close alliance between savings and loans and the government.
The Great Depression tightened the bonds of that relationship due to the
widespread S&amp;L failures and their subsequent foreclosing of borrowers'
homes. The federal government undertook measures designed to increase
stability in that industry: the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932 set up
a national network of Federal Home Loan banks arranged similarly to the
Federal Reserve System for banks that supplied funds during tough times;
the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 empowered the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board (FHLBB)&mdash;the S&amp;L's industry's overseer&mdash;to charter
federal S&amp;Ls and established a temporary means by which homeowners
could refinance their delinquent mortgages on terms that they could
afford; and the National Housing Act of 1934 created the S&amp;L
industry's deposit insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation (FSLIC).<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a> This legislative
triumvirate formed the foundation for the savings and loan industry
throughout the industry's remaining existence.
</p>
<p>
The fifties and sixties were the heyday of the S&amp;Ls because of the
postwar housing boom and a series of favorable government actions. The
industry flourished because it was able to price rates paid to depositors
relatively freely, while banks were restricted by rate ceilings imposed by
the Federal Reserve. Similarly, S&amp;Ls were given tax breaks that
effectively allowed them to pay no federal income taxes. Finally,
throughout the period, the government allowed the S&amp;Ls to diversify
their portfolios&mdash;increasing their holdings in commercial real estate
and securities while diminishing their mortgage holdings.<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a>
It also allowed S&amp;Ls to participate in investments that yielded high
returns&mdash;a move that would come back to bite them later as those
risky investments crashed.
</p>
<p>
The seventies were a period of stagnation for the S&amp;Ls due to the
rampant inflation and spiraling interest rates. The effects of
disintermediation came to the fore, as they held low-interest, long-term
mortgages and high-interest, short-term deposits. This resulted in a
credit crunch since S&amp;L executives could not reasonably lend money at
the interest rates they had to pay on deposits in order to stay solvent.
They entered the next decade full of hope for some remedy to their
predicament.
</p>
<p>
They got one. Ronald Reagan and his administration slowed and then ended
the inflation of the seventies. Congress enacted the Depository
Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 which eased
restrictions on reserve requirements, allowed the S&amp;Ls to offer new
credit instruments, and raised the deposit insurance coverage ceiling from
$40,000 to $100,000 per account.<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a> These
had the desired effects and the industry prospered once again. Subsequent
relaxation of regulation allowed S&amp;Ls to broker deposits nationally,
invest up to 10% of their portfolio in high-yield corporate bonds
(otherwise known as "junk" bonds), and eliminate loan-to-value ratio
restrictions on secured loans. This deregulation enabled S&amp;Ls to
attract deposits by paying premium rates while simultaneously either
lending that money at lucrative rates or parking that money in
high-yielding, high-risk investments. Since deposit insurance would cover
any mistakes made and S&amp;Ls were much cheaper to purchase than banks
due to their size, many high-flying businessmen bought S&amp;Ls with
little knowledge of the potential for insolvency. They then ran them as
short-term cash machines until they stopped allowing withdrawals.
Naturally, there were S&amp;L operators that were reasonable and not
profligate. However, they were forced to offer premium rates and
competitive lending packages in order to compete. They soon found
themselves in the same boat&mdash;albeit not as luxurious of one as the
big spenders&mdash;as their investments turned sour or commercial real
estate experienced a downturn. As S&amp;L after S&amp;L failed and the
rest of them were left teetering on the edge of insolvency, the FSLIC
became insolvent. Congress failed to appropriate sufficient funds to prop
up the FSLIC and so it too failed. Public confidence in both government
and the S&amp;L industry vanished as costs (or the potential costs) of the
crisis mounted in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
</p>
<p>
The S&amp;L industry was effectively terminated by the 1989 passage of the
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).
This act eliminated the FHLBB and transferred regulatory control to the
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in the Treasury Department. The FSLIC
was transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which
was the bank's deposit insurance fund. Funds were appropriated to assist
teetering S&amp;Ls and replenish the FSLIC. Housing programs were enacted
and administered by the Federal Home Loan banks, regulatory restrictions
were tightened, and criminal penalties were stepped up for financial
institution fraud. The death knell had sounded for the industry as an
independent entity. Obviously, the complete story cannot be told in this
forum since it is a review of the secondary literature on the crisis.
</p>
<p>
Now that we have some basic context, let us take a look at what writers
have said about the crisis. First we will examine the journalistic
accounts and then the academic ones. Since these terms are used many times
in the literature review, it is crucial that they be properly understood.
A "journalistic" account is one that explores the chronology of events
without delving into their natures, one which&mdash;like a newspaper
article&mdash;focuses on personalities. This does not mean that
"journalistic" books are inherently bad or of lesser quality; they have a
different focus because they aim at a different audience. This also does
not mean that "journalistic" works lack footnotes or extensive research, a
common charge against reporters. "Academic" writing is that which examines
the crisis on a more abstract level. Rather than chronicling events,
academic writing seeks to illuminate underlying causes and relate events
to other events. By and large, though, academic writing should strive for
integration&mdash;the tying together of separate disciplines and fields.
"Academic" is not necessarily produced by professors or those affiliated
with universities, nor are "journalistic" works produced solely by
non-academics. As mentioned previously, the best writing combines the both
styles: conveying an organized and thorough analysis through lively
writing and a human orientation.
</p>
<p>
In reviewing the literature on this subject, we will focus on
understanding how the authors comprehended the causes of the crisis. We
will do this because there is relatively little disagreement on the
effects. One can directly see that there is no S&amp;L industry in
existence today or look at the expenditures of the government in bailing
out the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC, pronounced
"fizz-lick"). Understanding the long, complex chain of events that
precipitated those effects is another story entirely. First, it involves
quite a bit of economic understanding. Second, practically every event
that transpired during the crisis seemed to have a unique cause. Finally,
writers tend to play down causes that contradict their basic world-view.
Where and how an author assigns blame speaks volumes about his beliefs and
perspective. Our examination of causation in the literature will also
serve to show the uniqueness of the proposed paper's perspective.
</p>
<p>
In surveying the journalists' accounts of the crisis, one finds some
fairly solid efforts that bear mention and a smattering of casual
treatments. The best of the bunch is Martin Lowy's <cite>High Rollers:
Inside the Savings and Loan Debacle</cite> (1991). Lowy is a lawyer who
has represented the New York State Superintendent of Banks, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and many financial institutions over
the course of his career. He argues that fraud was not the cause of the
S&amp;L crisis but was instead a symptom, used to "conceal the failing
institution's true financial condition." Lowy contends that the S&amp;L
crisis was a "fundamental economic failure of a substantial part of our
financial system."<a href="#6" class="footnote">6</a> For Lowy, the crisis
evolved in three phases: first, losses in 1978 through 1982 resulting from
interest rate increases; second, losses from risky loans made from 1982
through 1985 that they did not record until 1986 through 1989 due to
accounting practices; and finally, losses due to the government's
hesitation in closing insolvent S&amp;Ls after 1989.<a href="#7" class="footnote">7</a>
As far as he goes, Lowy makes some valid points&mdash;he spends roughly a
third to a half of the book explaining the nature of S&amp;Ls and how the
crisis happened. Unfortunately, he often gets mired in personalities and
omits much of the historical context of the S&amp;Ls. These faults aside,
he thoroughly understands the thrift industry and is very lucid in
explaining it&mdash;much more so than his fellow non-academic writers.
</p>
<p>
L. William Seidman's <cite>Full Faith and Credit: The Great S&amp;L
Debacle and Other Washington Sagas</cite> (1993) stands out from among the
other journalistic accounts since it was written by the chairman of the
FDIC from 1985 until 1991 and a former dean of Arizona State University's
College of Business. Although the book reads like a memoir and has no
footnotes or references, his unique perspective on events as head of the
banking industry's regulatory body more than compensates for any
inadequacies. He argues that the S&amp;L industry was doomed from the
start because it "defied the first safety rule taught in Finance 101" by
borrowing money (deposits) at short terms at high rates and selling money
(mortgages) at long terms and low rates. Seidman believes that the whole
crisis resulted from "a witch's brew consisting of four equal portions of
misguided policy": first, the S&amp;L industry was allowed to venture into
new sources of revenue and engage in risky projects; second, the S&amp;L
was permitted to substitute more lenient regulatory accounting principles
(RAP) for the traditional generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP);
third, the government regulators were ordered to go easier on the S&amp;L
industry; and finally, Congress increased the deposit insurance ceiling
from $40,000 per account to $100,000.<a href="#8" class="footnote">8</a>
He further notes that "high-flying speculators did not take long to
realize that owning an S&amp;L was a key to the Treasury."<a href="#9" class="footnote">9</a>
</p>
<p>
Thus, Seidman believes that the S&amp;L crisis was a mixture of malformed
government institutions with a human nature primed for taking advantage of
it. Like many of the Founding Fathers, Seidman holds that the purpose of
government is to place limitations on human corruptibility. As he puts it,
"do not underestimate the ability of private-sector bankers and financial
executives to do dumb things."<a href="#10" class="footnote">10</a> The
solution, for Seidman, is to re-establish government control over our
financial institutions by placing control over the banking system in one
regulatory agency and giving regulators more access and more power over
their charges. This is a perspective and outlook wholly consonant with one
who has spent a decade in the upper echelons of government service.
</p>
<p>
The last of the good journalistic efforts is Paul Zane Pilzer and Robert
Deitz's <cite>Other People's Money: The Inside Story of the S&amp;L
Mess</cite> (1989). Pilzer, an adviser to the Bush administration and
multimillionaire businessman, and Deitz, a Pulitzer Prize-nominated
journalist for the <cite>Dallas Times Herald</cite>, offer a terse and
lucid account of the S&amp;L crisis that is heavy on personality but light
on details and context&mdash;although they do spend an inordinate amount
of pages describing the disagreement between Franklin Roosevelt and Huey
Long on deposit insurance. The pair concludes that the fundamental cause
of the S&amp;L debacle is a deposit insurance system that "encourag[es]
speculation, greed, fraud, and mismanagement on the part of thrift
owners."<a href="#11" class="footnote">11</a> To reform that system,
Pilzer and Deitz propose that deposit insurance extend only to one account
per person and that it only cover the first $10,000 at 100% (90% after
that up to $100,000). They also suggest increasing the penalties for
white-collar theft from a financial institution since they believe that
such fraud was prevalent. Finally, they want the "concept of thrift that
built this nation [to] be restored to the American character" through tax
incentives and new types of savings accounts.<a href="#12" class="footnote">12</a>
Their perspective seems to be an admixture of journalistic
insiderism&mdash;that the real decisions in government are made in
back-room, closed-door meetings&mdash;and confidence in the power of the
relatively free market. This is exactly the point of view one would expect
from a collaboration between a businessman and a reporter.
</p>
<p>
The remainder of the journalistic efforts are almost exactly what one
would read in the newspapers. They all have sensational headlines for book
titles with dramatic expos&eacute;s for content. One can comprehend James
Ring Adam's <cite>The Big Fix</cite> by its subtitle: "How an Unholy
Alliance of Politics and Money Destroyed America's Banking System." His
predominantly anecdotal account views the crisis as prosecuted by crooked
businessmen and the politicians they bought. His writing style is
exemplified by this passage: "[E]ach coup has brought more open
involvement by the politicians. Subtlety has dropped away, until members
of Congress applied crude extortion on behalf of their pet swindlers."<a href="#13" class="footnote">13</a>
The heroes of his story are the dedicated government regulators who
uncovered their schemes.
</p>
<p>
Michael Waldman's <cite>Who Robbed America? A Citizen's Guide to the
S&amp;L Scandal</cite> takes much the same tack as Adams. Written by the
director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch, this book predictably indicts
the wealthy investors and depositors of the failed thrifts and the
Congressmen in their pocket. Waldman's basic argument is that deregulation
led to a "Wild West atmosphere."<a href="#14" class="footnote">14</a> His
resolution for the problem is to tax the wealthy to pay for the bailout,
to create a citizen's oversight group for the financial industry, to
publicly finance Congressional elections, to use racketeering laws in the
prosecution of white-collar criminals operating out of financial
institutions, and to end "destructive" deregulation.<a href="#15" class="footnote">15</a>
His account of the causes and proposal for resolution reveal his
motivations; for him, corrupt businessmen bribe otherwise aboveboard
politicians into overlooking their transgressions and corruption. Since
the businessmen who committed fraud have been punished, he thinks it is
time to soak the rich through progressive taxation since they, presumably,
all benefitted from the debacle.
</p>
<p>
The authors of <cite>Inside Job: The Looting of America's Savings and
Loans</cite> contend that the S&amp;L crisis was part of an organized
network of fraud. Stephen Pizzo, Mary Fricker, and Paul Muolo&mdash;all
reporters at the time&mdash;dance around the conclusion that the mob was
behind the looting of the industry. As they put it, they "never once
examined a thrift&mdash;no matter how random the choice&mdash;without
finding someone there whom we already knew from another failed S&amp;L."<a href="#16" class="footnote">16</a>
The implication is that that network was the Mafia and that implication is
confirmed in several places when S&amp;L officials are mentioned as
"exchang[ing] their Mafia bona fides" or being "associated with one of the
Mafia's most powerful godfathers, Carlos Marcello."<a href="#17" class="footnote">17</a>
This is the only book of the lot that makes such claims and accusations,
but the book contains impressive endnotes and it would be surprising if
organized crime was not involved in some fashion in such a profitable
industry.
</p>
<p>
The last two books are at the bottom of an already deep barrel. Kathleen
Day's oddly-titled <cite>S&amp;L Hell: The People and Politics behind the
$1 Trillion Savings and Loan Scandal</cite> (1993) is nothing but
personality, with nearly no analysis. The following passage says it all:
</p>
<blockquote>
Other treatments of the S&amp;L crisis have offered a range of
explanations for the industry's problems: the influence of organized
crime, a conspiracy on Wall Street, imperfections in the market, and so
on. All of these&mdash;to which, perhaps, the roles of greed and ambition
should be added&mdash;may have played some part. But while the temptation
is great to offer the debacle as a paradigm for the failures of
regulation, this book doesn't advance a grand theory. If there are some
obvious lessons for the future to be learned from these stories, I've left
them for the reader to draw.<a href="#18" class="footnote">18</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
The other book, Martin Mayer's <cite>The Greatest-Ever Bank Robbery</cite>,
faces similar problems albeit with a little more analysis. He regards
deposit insurance as the ultimate culprit, but buries that conclusion in a
narrative made difficult to read by the number of
<em>dramatis personae</em> used. Institutions and structures, if they play
a role at all, are entirely secondary. His writing style is also much more
glib than any of the other authors: "I have used in my chapter headings
the metaphor of an automobile accident because it's fun."<a href="#19" class="footnote">19</a>
</p>
<p>
In sum, all of these journalistic works discuss the same events but arrive
at different conclusions and write at different levels of detail. There
are a couple of excellent works that go to considerable lengths in
covering their subject and make cogent arguments and then there are plenty
that read like very long newspaper articles. Generally, though, they view
the S&amp;L crisis as resulting from industry excesses and symbolic for
what they regard as the excesses of the eighties. They also were in
agreement that the savings and loan industry occupied a unique position in
the American economy, largely because it had a powerful lobbying group.
They varied in the intensity with which they blamed the industry&mdash;some
placed the blame solely on the S&amp;Ls while others spread the
responsibility among several players, including the government, organized
crime, real estate markets, and securities traders. These variations
define the evaluative hierarchy used in this review.
</p>
<p>
Academic writings follow a similar hierarchy of value. There are a couple
of works at the top and then it goes down from there. Perhaps the best
account of the whole crisis is James Barth's <cite>The Great Savings and
Loan Debacle</cite>, published as a Special Analysis Report by the
American Enterprise Institute Press in 1991. Barth is currently a finance
professor at Auburn University, but spent his time during the S&amp;L
crisis as the chief economist of the FHLBB and OTS from September 1987
through November 1989. Barth sees a number of factors contributing to the
S&amp;L crisis and one unifying cause. Among the factors, Barth cites a
rigid institutional design, high and volatile interest rates,
deterioration in asset quality, federal and state deregulation, fraudulent
practices, increased competition in the financial services industry,
changes in tax law, and increased participation in risky activities.<a href="#20" class="footnote">20</a>
The more fundamental cause, he argues, is federal deposit insurance
itself.<a href="#21" class="footnote">21</a> Deposit insurance acted to
repress the discipline that was supplied previously by depositors.
Government regulators, acting as proxies for depositors, attempted to
control the risky activities but did not "reorganize or close inadequately
capitalized institutions in a timely manner" resulting in heavy losses.<a href="#22" class="footnote">22</a>
</p>
<p>
In order to counteract what he regards as the negative incentives inherent
in deposit insurance, Barth offers the following proposals: enactment of
"narrow bank" rules that stipulate that all insured deposits must be
matched by 100% reserves and that any lending or ancillary activities
should be engaged in using excess capital rather than deposits; retention
of the deposit insurance system while lowering the amounts protected or
seeking coinsurance; supplanting federal deposit insurance in favor of
industry-sponsored deposit insurance; usage of reinsurance, whereby a
private reinsurer would insure the difference between the government's
coverage and the institution's total deposits by charging a premium based
on risk&mdash;this premium would then be used by the government for
computation of its premium since the private reinsurer has a larger
incentive to accumulate accurate information than the government.<a href="#23" class="footnote">23</a>
His conclusions about reform are surprising given his extensive
participation in the regulatory apparatus, but they obviously stem from a
disdain for unwarranted government interference in the banking industry.
</p>
<p>
The next best academic work is Lawrence White's <cite>The S&amp;L Debacle:
Public Policy Lessons for Bank and Thrift Regulation</cite>, published by
the Oxford University Press in 1991. White is an New York University
professor and noted economist who served as a board member on the FHLBB
from November 12, 1986 until August 18, 1989. With these impeccable
credentials, White's book seeks to divine and divulge the lessons of the
S&amp;L crisis for regulators. He views the S&amp;L crisis as caused by
the limitations of the regulators&mdash;the opposite of the view
propounded by Barth. He attributes the cause of the crisis to six factors:
flawed information systems used by regulators, non-risk based deposit
insurance premiums, deregulation that was sound but poorly implemented,
and cleanup legislation that did not provide adequate funds or fundamental
reforms.<a href="#24" class="footnote">24</a> In fact, he explicitly
states:
</p>
<blockquote>
[T]he cause of the problem was the creation in the early 1980s of a
specific set of opportunities, capabilities, and incentives for
risk-taking by thrifts that were reinforced by a set of perverse federal
policy actions that weakened the safety-and-soundness regulatory system at
a time when it needed to be substantially strengthened&mdash;and all of
these events interacted, with an exquisite sense of timing, with movements
in the price of oil and changes in the tax laws. In essence, the cause of
the problem was the <em>specific way</em> in which the deposit insurance
system for thrifts was structured and administered in the early
1980s.<a href="#25" class="footnote">25</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
For White, then, the causes of the S&amp;L crisis were institutional. The
structure of the thrift system was set up in a certain way, the thrifts
took advantage of that structure, economic conditions revealed the
weaknesses in the structure, and the structure tumbled down. To prevent
this from happening again, we must rebuild the structure and strengthen
its defects. He suggests a number of reforms: switching from GAAP to a
system he calls market value accounting, essentially forcing management to
reveal all assets and liabilities in terms of their current market value
instead of their historical market value; tying deposit insurance premiums
to the riskiness of the institution; early intervention and prompt
disposal of ailing thrifts; extending deposit insurance coverage to 100%
of deposits; increasing the use of long-term subordinated debt, which
would act as a front-line of defense for insolvent institutions before
invoking deposit insurance protection; and setting up the Treasury as an
automatic backup for deposit insurance funds instead of requiring
Congressional approval for Treasury expenditures to cover deposit
insurance shortfalls. As we will see over the course of the literature
survey, these are the most radical reforms proposed and they underscore
White's regulator background and perspective.
</p>
<p>
The remaining academic books on the subject focus exclusively on political
aspects of the crisis. Mark Carl Rom's <cite>Public Spirit in the Thrift
Tragedy</cite>, published by the University of Pittsburgh Press in 1996,
is an excellent account of Congress' action and reaction to the events of
the crisis. Rom wants to show that Congressmen were actually motivated by
public spirit.<a href="#26" class="footnote">26</a> Rom positions his view
as an antipode to public choice theory, which argues that
politicians&mdash;like everyone else&mdash;act solely in their own
self-interest and use their power to advance their careers and material
well-being. While his thesis is interesting, it has little relevance to
the topic at hand. The motivations of those who handled the evolving
crisis do not explain fundamentally why it happened. There was too much
history there; it is obvious that Congress and administration officials
were primarily reacting to events, struggling to right a listing ship that
inevitably sunk. Ultimately, Rom's work focuses on his thesis and not on
the underlying causes of the crisis&mdash;although he does offer some
suggestions for causes that differ little from those of the previous two
works.
</p>
<p>
Ned Eichler suggests that a trio of factors&mdash;ideology, personality,
and circumstance&mdash;caused the crisis in his 1989 book <cite>The Thrift
Debacle</cite>, published by the University of California Press. The
ideology of deregulation had taken hold of the country's elected officials
and it was well-suited to the thrift industry, which had long been
subsidized and sheltered by the federal government. For personality,
Reagan appointee to the FHLBB Richard Pratt &quot;brought fierce
determination, contempt for the industry he was about to supervise, and
arrogance to the job.&quot;<a href="#27" class="footnote">27</a> The
circumstances of the thrift industry round out the litany of factors.
Eichler's lays the fundamental blame, though, on Ronald Reagan:
</p>
<blockquote>
But the history of the thrift debacle must someday place the primary blame
where it belongs, on Reagan, an ideological puritan who proclaimed the
virtues of deregulation and then left its implementation to men ill
equipped to handle such a delicate task. When asked why he did not ever
brief Reagan on the severity of the thrift situation, its causes, and the
steps required to deal with it, [former FHLBB chairman] Gray replied that
Reagan had no interest in the matter.<a href="#28" class="footnote">28</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is certainly a unique attribution of responsibility. The source of
the S&amp;L industry's problems, though, predates Reagan's terms and it is
problematic to assign blame to Reagan for even those areas over which he
delegated authority. The President of the United States suffers from the
same limitations as every other human being: limited knowledge and
fallible judgment.
</p>
<p>
The last of the academic works is <cite>Big Money Crime: Fraud and
Politics in the Savings and Loan Crisis</cite>, published in 1997 by the
University of California Press. Its authors&mdash;Kitty Calavita, Henry
Pontell, and Robert Tillman&mdash;make the incredible claim that everybody
else has gotten it wrong about the S&amp;L crisis. In actuality, the
crisis occurred due to the criminal activities of the S&amp;L executives.
They start the book right off with the following bold statement:
</p>
<blockquote>
We believe a different approach is in order, as a number of myths have
come to permeate popular understandings of the S&amp;L scandal. Too often,
for example, economists and financial experts have attributed the disaster
to faulty business decisions or business risks gone awry. We argue instead
that deliberate insider fraud was at the center of the disaster.
Furthermore, we contend that systematic political collusion&mdash;not just
policy error&mdash;was a critical ingredient in this unprecedented series
of frauds.<a href="#29" class="footnote">29</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Their chronicling of the crimes committed by S&amp;L insiders is
fascinating, but overstated. To argue as they do that honest mistakes
played little or no part in the crisis or that the whole system was
corrupt is ludicrous since it is demonstrably wrong. Individual S&amp;L
managers committed plenty of crimes, to be sure, but one would expect
criminals to be attracted to the huge amounts the S&amp;Ls dealt with and
it was not nearly as widespread as the authors contend. Moreover, that
crime points to a larger issue: what allowed criminals to engage in their
crimes undetected for so long? It was assuredly the system that failed and
permitted such frauds.
</p>
<p>
The academic writers, then, tend to vary along the same continuum as the
journalistic writers. As mentioned earlier, the journalistic authors
assigned different degrees of culpability to the savings and loan
industry&mdash;some more and some less. The extremes, though, were farther
along the continuum than their journalistic counterparts; the authors that
held the industry less guilty found them almost blameless while those who
argued that the industry was culpable found them exclusively so&mdash;even
criminal. Their focus is what unites all of the works: they all target the
institutions for special analysis, introducing the human elements
anecdotally. Whether they discuss the political dimensions of the crisis
or the economic ones, all of the academics subject the institutional
structures to thorough analysis. The only problem, already mentioned, is
that they tend to focus on the institutions that fit in their particular
specialty&mdash;economists examine the economic aspects of the industry
while political scientists and sociologists look at the political issues.
</p>
<p>
One common element obtains throughout these works. Nearly all of them, in
some form or another, blame the crisis on deregulation. Like the current
California electrical troubles, deregulation is not responsible for the
crisis. The financial services industry is, and always has been, one of
the most heavily regulated areas of the economy. The deregulation put
forth by the Reagan administration in the eighties eliminated some of the
more odious regulations such as interest rate caps, portfolio
diversification restrictions, and interstate banking restrictions. The
industry as a whole was still left very much regulated and controlled. A
myriad of regulatory agencies and an army of bureaucrats still oversaw the
nation's financial institutions. As economist Richard Salsman put it,
"these freedoms were not 'permitted' out of any desire by politicians to
strengthen the banking system, but simply to forestall the collapse of
some of the unsound institutions within it. Ceilings on interest rates
were lifted only after they had led to massive disintermediation."<a href="#30" class="footnote">30</a>
The rescinded regulations were, perhaps, the wrong ones to roll back since
they encouraged unethical and irrational behavior. However, the remaining
regulations did the same if not more so. Deposit insurance, which was
left, allowed executives to take risky moves because the executives knew
that the depositors would always be safe. Similarly, the lack of owner
equity meant that these same executives would suffer no financial
repercussions should they bet incorrectly. Moreover, the Federal Reserve
and the FHLBB propped up failing institutions much longer than they should
have thereby prolonging their lives and increasing the costs of the
eventual bailout. What existed in the eighties was not
<em>deregulation</em>&mdash;since that would mean wholesale elimination of
regulations&mdash;but <em>decreased</em> regulation. This is an important
distinction to remember and take note of because it can lead to a masking
of blame when industry is blamed on the assumption that it is acting
freely when it is not.
</p>
<p>
The works covered in this literature review suffer from a number of
deficiencies. The covered books' biggest problem is that they are too
specialized. The journalistic accounts focused mostly on the players in
the S&amp;L crisis, such as Charles Keating, Neil Bush, and the Keating
Five. They typically only delved into institutional analysis in the final
chapter when they offered up their plan for resolution. The academic
accounts, on the other hand were suffused with institutional analysis, but
it was typically restricted to either the economic or political aspects of
the crisis. The best work would include an analysis of both areas. An
economic understanding of the S&amp;L industry is invaluable to explaining
why the industry regularly appealed to Congress for assistance. Similarly,
an examination of the industry's economic underpinnings without an
exploration of the political dimensions omits half the story since the
S&amp;L industry was essentially a creature of the government's creation.
The economic and political aspects of the S&amp;L crisis were, in other
words, inextricably intertwined; devoting insufficient space to either
leaves the story untold. To be sure, not all of the works dramatically
fail in this regard. Lowy's <cite>High Rollers</cite>, Seidman's <cite>Full
Faith and Credit</cite>, Barth's <cite>The Great Savings and Loan
Debacle</cite>, and White's <cite>The S&amp;L Debacle</cite> all come
close to achieving that integration, but each falls short.
</p>
<p>
All of the works also fail to adequately contrast the savings and loans
with the banks. The crisis presents a prime opportunity to compare the
S&amp;Ls with the banks since they were both encountered the same troubles
and faced much the same regulatory environment. The banking industry still
exists today&mdash;and in a much stronger form. The S&amp;Ls are gone, no
longer in existence. This fact alone merits considerable attention. When
two industries face the same obstacles and one dies while the other
thrives, something important is happening. A thorough examination of this
situation could provide the key to understanding the nature and causes of
the S&amp;L crisis. Without going into detail&mdash;which would require
another essay&mdash;it appears that the S&amp;L industry went bust because
there was never a market rationale for its existence. Thus, when their
situation worsened, they could only beg Congress for a bailout. The
failing banks, on the other hand, were bought out by stronger banks. These
newly-merged banks were then able to ride out the hard times and
eventually prospered. Clearly, the juxtaposition of the savings and loans
and the banks yields useful insights into the crisis.
</p>
<p>
The final deficiency of the literature reviewed is its national scope.
While the issues are clearly national, showing how the issues played out
at the local level offers three benefits. First, it limits the number of
concretes to consider. This enables the reader to keep a better handle on
the facts presented and the arguments made. Too many of the journalistic
efforts presented dozens of characters in their narratives. Second, a
local perspective narrows the focus of a work. Rather than skimpily
researching dozens of institutions, regulatory agencies, and individuals,
a local focus allows the writer to throughly research a handful of
entities. Finally, although the S&amp;L crisis played itself out
nationally, the circumstances of a couple major cities were repeated over
and over. For example, the S&amp;Ls in Phoenix and Dallas could almost be
archetypes for the rest of the nation since there was little variation
from their collapse. What some of the works should have done is explored
the national issues and then show how those theories actually looked at
the local level. In so doing, one could not help but unite the economic
and political aspects of the crisis since one would be looking at the
actual situations within an already-developed theoretical framework.
</p>
<p>
What this field needs, then, is a broad work that juxtaposes the banking
industry with the savings and loans and applies the knowledge gained to
the local level. Let us now turn our attention to these three
aspects&mdash;broadness, inclusion of the banking industry, and
localness&mdash;of a proposed paper that would remedy the deficiencies
noted in the current literature. To insure depth of analysis, the paper
should be divided into two major sections: context and analysis. The first
section would begin with a chronology of events in order to provide the
reader with a basic framework to understand the events. An exploration of
the major regulations affecting banks and S&amp;Ls would follow and that
would be followed by a look at the market conditions surrounding banks and
S&amp;Ls in the seventies and eighties. The paper would next cover the
changes that occurred in the banking industry and then the actual events
of the crisis. Finally, the paper would deal with the aftermath of the
debacle and the look of banking today. The analytical portion of the paper
would address some of the more theoretical points raised by the
context-defining section. A survey of the different theories of causation
and an evaluation of their merits would start off the analysis. Finally,
the paper would explore the author's thesis and hypothesis of causation.
Possible objections would be raised and, one hopes, refuted. This
structure seems to cover the most territory with the most efficiency.
Moreover, the ordering of the sections exemplifies the need for
conclusions to await the explication of the relevant facts of reality.
Within each section, parts are ordered in logical progression&mdash;each
building on the one prior. By the end, the whole structure should stand or
fall based on the foundations laid in the first section and the
construction methods used in the second.
</p>
<p>
The work should focus on three subjects: the savings and loan industry,
the banking industry, and the federal government. These are the three key
players, so to speak, in the S&amp;L debacle. There are other minor
players that can be brought in for bit parts including junk bonds,
commercial real estate, and criminal executives. These were not monolithic
entities: the banking industry, for example, is composed of huge
multinational banks, community banks, and banking associations. However,
they all faced a similar, basic set of problems that united their
interests. This allows us to treat them as a single unit instead of
discussing them separately due to inconsequential
differences&mdash;inconsequential insofar as they did not represent
fundamental distinctions. We will study these three principals by first
examining the historical contexts with which they came to the events of
the late eighties. For the S&amp;L industry, we will look at its founding
in the nineteenth century, its troubles in the latter half of that
century, its enshrinement in the American firmament by the New Deal, its
growth in the fifties, retrenchment in the sixties and seventies, its peak
in the early eighties, its collapse in the late eighties, and its
elimination in the early nineties. For the banking industry, we will start
a little later with the rise of the national banks in the late nineteenth
century then move on to the creation of the Federal Reserve System in
1913, the bank runs of the Great Depression, the establishment of deposit
insurance in the New Deal legislation of the thirties, the technological
changes of the sixties and seventies, the changes to banking law of the
eighties, the rise of the national bank in the late eighties and nineties,
and the banking climate of today. In our study of the federal government's
interaction with these two industries, we will examine the creation of the
Federal Reserve System, the issuance of a myriad of regulations governing
every aspect of the two industries, the changes made to those regulations
over the period, and the changes in the political environment over time.
In covering all of these areas, we can fully establish the context
necessary for understanding the course of the S&amp;L debacle.
</p>
<p>
The concentration on local events would permit the writer to show how the
industries affected and were affected by the communities they served.
Since banks and S&amp;Ls at the time were strictly local (and perhaps
regional) enterprises, adopting a national perspective is not particularly
useful. The paper should center around a major city that changed and was
changed by the S&amp;Ls. Phoenix, Arizona is a particularly poignant
example of such a city. Its real estate market attracted national
investment from both banks and savings and loans. Moreover, it had both a
thriving banking community and a thriving thrift community. Because of its
phenomenal growth during the fifties, sixties, and seventies, Phoenix's
real estate market practically ached for all the capital financial
institutions could muster. When that market collapsed in the mid-eighties,
it took these same financial institutions with it. The holdings of these
failed institutions were either bought by stronger banks or sold off at
substantial discounts. There is plenty of research to conduct along such
lines and the documentation produced by the industry and its regulators is
voluminous. Newspaper accounts of the time would probably have innumerable
stories about the local impact of the S&amp;L crisis.
</p>
<p>
To review, this paper's proposed thesis is that the thrift industry faced
a similar set of problems as the commercial banking industry during the
1980s&mdash;disintermediation, increased competition, disincentives
introduced by deposit insurance, deregulation, fraud, and
mismanagement&mdash;but was hamstrung by government edict while the banks
were considerably freer. When events took a turn for the worse, the
failing savings and loans required government assistance whereas the
failing banks were bought by larger banks. The lesson of the S&amp;L
debacle, then, is not that Congress should make regulations more stringent
or that we should reform deposit insurance; instead, we should eliminate
government intervention in the banking system. The S&amp;L industry
substantially duplicated the role and function of the banks and was
dwindling in impact until 1933 when the Roosevelt administration
resurrected it and gave it special advantages. There is no reason why the
government should be in the business of propping up one industry in
preference to another. The preceding will constitute the thesis and theme
of the paper.
</p>
<p>
This proposed paper would add to the scholarship available on this crisis.
Its perspective is unique in that it compares and contrasts the banking
industry, which survived, with the thrift industry, which did not. In
seeking to answer why the discrepancy exists, the paper would yield
valuable insights into why some businesses fail and the why public
solutions often produce undesired and undesirable results. In addition, it
would provide comment on an area where little exists currently: the state
of banking during the savings and loan crisis. Finally, it would address
theoretical concerns about centralized banking and offer potential
substitutes for its shortcomings.

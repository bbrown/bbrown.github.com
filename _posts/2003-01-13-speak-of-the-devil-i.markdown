<br />Speak of the devil, I went to the <a href="http://www.phoenixpubliclibrary.org/web/ec/saguaro.html" title="The branch nearest my work.">library</a> to return some movies (<cite><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0109445" title="Bad movie. Waste of time.">Clerks</a></cite> and <cite><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0081949" title="Great movie, loved the book by Nevil Shute.">A Town Like Alice</a></cite>) and what should I encounter while browsing but <cite><a href="http://www.lomborg.com/books.htm">The Skeptical Environmentalist</a></cite>.<br /><br />Taking a cue from <a href="http://www.tesugen.com/" title="Interesting weblog">Tesugen</a>, I'm going to post regular updates on my thoughts about the book as I plow through it. I don't think I'll go chapter-by-chapter because there are twenty-five of them and most of them are pretty mundane sounding&#x2014;like "Food and Hunger" and "Energy."<br /><br /><br />

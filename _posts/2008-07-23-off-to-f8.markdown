<p>
I'm getting ready to fly out to San Francisco for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/f8">F8 Conference</a> put on by Facebook. We're leaving Phoenix at 7:20 AM and returning to Sky Harbor by 10:30 PM, so it's going to be a long day but very much worth it&#x2014;I hope. I plan to blog my raw notes for each session throughout the conference for my colleagues that couldn't attend as well as posterity.

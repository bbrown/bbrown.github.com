<br />I propose a new acronym: YACGC (Yet Another California Gubernatorial Candidate). Incidentally, I've found another <a href="http://www.clementsforgovernor.com/">one</a>. His motto is "Maximize the Economy, Minimize the Government." Sounds good, but <a href="http://www.clementsforgovernor.com/plan-faq.html#traffic">he doesn't stand a chance</a>.<br /><br />Why is it that every Objectivist or Libertarian shoots his or her wad early by rallying around private roads or legalizing drugs? These premature emancipations really hurt their chances when an incremental approach might yield some actual results which can then be built upon.<br /><br /><br />

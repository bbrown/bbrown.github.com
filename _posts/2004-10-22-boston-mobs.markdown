<br />Is <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=50315">this</a> a modern-day Boston Massacre? One <a href="http://www.bostonmassacre.net/">occurred</a> because of strained tensions between an oppressed populace and an occupying army and the other occurred because, umm, the Boston Red Sox won the American League championships.<br /><br />It's a disgusting example of collectivism and nihilism.<br /><br /><br />

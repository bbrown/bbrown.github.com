I love it when I come across evidence of a sense of humor when reading technical documentation. I bet someone at Apple had a good time crafting this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<code>Listing 1&#xA0; An hour and a half from now<br />NSDate *today = [NSDate date];<br />NSDateComponents *offsetComponents = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];<br />[offsetComponents setHour:1];<br />[offsetComponents setMinutes:30];<br /><b>// Calculate when, according to Tom Lehrer, World War III will end</b><br />NSDate *endOfWorldWar3 = [gregorian dateByAddingComponents:comps toDate:today options:0];
</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
For those that don't get the reference, watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pklr0UD9eSo">video of him performing it</a>. (My familiarity with the song was from countless Sunday nights listening to Doctor Demento on the radio.)

<br />I was always on the fence about wallpaper. I had seen a lot of horrid uses of it, but I'd also seen some great walls that were great because of it. I am now solidly in the "hate wallpaper" camp.<br /><br />We've been trying to take down some lovely pink wallpaper in my daughters' room since it was peeling in places. Apparently, those were the only places in the entire room where the wallpaper has not become one with the drywall. It has been a war of attrition and we're losing pretty badly.<br /><br />The lesson: make sure that you only buy wallpaper that will come off the wall like gauze bandages with the application of <a href="http://www.zinsser.com/product_detail.asp?ProductID=17">Dif</a>. Oh, and I learned that wallpaper, like <a href="http://www.boxoffice.com/scripts/fiw.dll?GetReview?&amp;where=ID&amp;terms=4220">Benjamin Franklin</a>, is the devil.<br /><br /><br />

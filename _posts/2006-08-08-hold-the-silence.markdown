<p>Phew, <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/WhyIPOPulled.html">that was rough</a>.</p>
<p>[UPDATE (8/9/2006): Okay, that wasn't very clear. I meant that the quiet period was rough. There is so much I wanted to say, especially about the S-1, but I couldn't. I'm going to mark my triumphant return to blogging with an analysis of the Go Daddy S-1 filing because there's many interesting things in there.]

<br />I think that tomorrow or Tuesday I will go see <cite>The Matrix Reloaded</cite>. I've seen enough crap on <acronym title="Television">TV</acronym> and read enough reviews on the Web to want to see what all the fuss is about. I <a href="/writings/html/thematrix.cfm">didn't like the first one</a>, but I'm all about benefit of the doubt. Naturally, seeing this one will force me to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0242653">the next one</a>&#x2014;stupid <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Wachowski,%20Andy">Wachowski</a> <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Wachowski,%20Larry">brothers</a>.<br /><br /><br />

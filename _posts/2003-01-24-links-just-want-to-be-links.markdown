<br />Note to self: remember to read <a href="http://tech.irt.org/articles/js200/">"Links Want To Be Links"</a> thoroughly. Also, comb through the <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/" title="Jukka Korpela's home page">author's site</a> for other such pearls.<br /><br />Note to anyone else: It's an article describing some of the best (read: most useful) ways to devise and phrase links. Very important subject and a very well-crafted article.<br /><br /><br />

<br /><a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic">Redmonk Steve</a> turned me on to <a href="http://hydra.globalse.org/">Hydra</a>, a programmer's text editor that focuses on collaboration.<br /><br />Now I've got no one with whom to collaborate&#x2014;though I hope to someday&#x2014;but it is god-damn fast! I normally use <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> for all my development needs, but it can be something of a memory hog, even on Thor who has 768MB of RAM. I still love jEdit profusely (and am toying ever so delicately with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>), but Hydra reminds me of what <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> did for me after years of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a> use: it's a great power application but too sluggish for daily use.<br /><br />Thanks, <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/">Steve</a>!<br /><br /><br />

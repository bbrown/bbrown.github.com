<br />During this morning's quarterly employee appreciation, Bob Parsons announced that Go Daddy is going to be subsidizing employee lunches. Subway and Meatballz bring in sub sandwiches every day for sale in one of the breakrooms for $3.50 and Go Daddy is going to pay half of that. Well, half of that rounded down to the nearest dollar. That means that I can be eating a Subway sandwich every day for $1! Hot damn!<br /><br />It's not quite <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/05/BUGJBE3GOI1.DTL">Google</a>, but it's a start. As a certified cheapskate, bringing lunch from home is now potentially more expensive than eating at work.<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

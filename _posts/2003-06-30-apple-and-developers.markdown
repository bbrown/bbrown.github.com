<br />Interesting. <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/27">Tim O'Reilly</a> has a <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3406">new blog entry</a> regarding Apple and its developer community along the lines of <a href="2003_06_22_diamonds.cfm#105641542114957280">my previous worry</a>. The <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3406#thread">discussion</a> taking place over there is especially insightful.<br /><br /><br />

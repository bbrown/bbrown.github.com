<br />At my last job, we used VisualStudio.NET deployment projects to reasonable effect. There were problems with installing and uninstalling web applications via MSIs, but it worked fairly well. I was never really satisfied with it, but I couldn't find any alternative that seemed better.<br /><br />Yesterday, my co-workers showed me the <a href="http://www.arunmicrosystems.netfirms.com/Deploy2.html">copy project feature</a> of VS.NET and I thought to myself, "Wha? That's all it takes?!!" You just specify the destination and it copies all the relevant project files to there.<br /><br />Today, a co-worker showed me a VisualStudio.NET add-in called <a href="http://www.eworldui.net/unleashit/">Unleash It</a> that makes VS.NET copy project feature look positively ancient. It adds a lot of the niceties that the VS.NET feature lacks: profiles, FTP, command-line, ZIP file creation, among others. It's free. Deployment now takes seconds, limited largely by your network (I've already mentioned how <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/speedy.cfm">great</a> ours is).<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

This <a href="http://bloomingrock.com/2012/02/14/what-you-want-to-see-in-arizonas-next-100-years/" rel="nofollow">list of things</a> some people would like to see come to pass in Arizona's next 100 years reads like a wish list for someone just airlifted in from Berkeley or Portland. It is so utterly divorced from reality that it almost could have come from <cite>The Onion</cite>.
</p>
<p>
Maybe I just don't get exposed to enough liberal, collectivist small-mindedness but the responses worry me. Could this represent some actual nascent movement that will eventually bear political fruit? I certainly hope that isn't the case.
</p>
<p>
I won't spend the time to do an exhaustive debunking, but here's a quick pass on the main points.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Solar</strong>: the only way that solar energy is <a href="http://www.masterresource.org/2011/12/solar-subsidy-misdirection/" title="Master Resource is a great blog that you should be reading.">economically "viable"</a> is through massive government subsidy. Not only is government subsidy becoming less and less available, you still need to have reliable energy plants idling due to the variability of solar power. The path to cheap energy is in <a href="http://www.chron.com/business/article/Natural-gas-boom-projected-to-fuel-job-growth-2347054.php" title="Natural gas is clean, safe, and abundant. Why is anyone pushing for wind or solar?">natural gas</a> but it should be left to individual decisions, expressed through market forces, to move us down that road. (Don't get me started about the collectivist notion behind <a href="http://www.coyoteblog.com/coyote_blog/2011/11/15291.html" title="Why should anyone care what other states or countries think of how we get our energy?">wanting Arizona</a> to be the leader in solar energy.)
</li>
<li>
<strong>Inclusivity/Diversity</strong>: I confess that I'm not as aware of politically-correct buzzwords as I was when I was in college. I think this is code for "stop Joe Arpaio from busting illegal immigrants." If so, then I'm down with that. But then someone expressed a desire for a "community where health care, education, food, housing and respect is fully accessible to all." That is the seen&mdash;unseen are the people who have their income removed to pay for that "accessibility." It reads like the mission statement for the Californication of Arizona, which I would vigorously oppose.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Sustainable Urbanism</strong>: every opinion expressed in that section is underlaid by the sentiment "here's how you're going to live." This is the petty tyranny of Portland. (To wit, one oaf advocates a "growth control boundary somewhere near the current 101" and then spins off into an arcology-centered fantasy. Reality's going to <a href="http://reason.org/files/c5ba9be86e1bda65352dcf0e87a46c5a.pdf" title="PDF examining the effects of urban growth boundaries. Hint: it ain't good.">be rough</a>.) It's like these people don't even understand that the "sprawling parking lots/black moats of strip malls and other buildings" they want to "inventively re-purpose" are private property. More likely, they don't care.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Infill Development</strong>: there's a reason why Phoenix is sprawling, some people even <a href="http://bbrown.info/2007/03/spoken-like-a-true-san-franciscan.html" title="Oh yeah, I said it.">like it</a>. One bright bulb even wants the "exurbs" to revert to agriculture; evidently missing out on the reduced need for farmland created the Agricultural Revolution as well as pining for the <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/09/detroit-looks-at-downsizing-to-save-city/?page=all" title="It makes me sick to see what Detroit, once the industrial center of the nation, has become.">situation facing Detroit</a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Bike-ability/Walkability/Transit</strong>: there's this fervent belief among these types that wishing <em>will</em> make it so. I personally do not want to walk or bike down to the corner store in the summer, much less be restricted to whatever's within range of a heat stroke. Don't even get me started on the <a href="http://www.coyoteblog.com/coyote_blog/2011/02/light-rail-and-sustainability.html" title="Great comments on that blog entry.">boondoggle</a> that is light rail.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is why I detest urban planning as a profession. The only way to effect a plan for an entire city is to exert power or pressure over the property owners of that city. You can do it through zoning, permitting, or incentives&mdash;each of these is a matter of force or coercion. I wish we could grow past such an impetus for our next 100 years.

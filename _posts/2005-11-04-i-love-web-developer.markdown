<br />Chris Pederick, he of <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/">incredible Firefox extensions</a>, has <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/beta/">released a beta</a> of the next release of his stunning <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/">Web Developer extension</a>.<br /><br />This isn't some piddly little update: it's a <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/documentation/todo/">frigging colossal jamboree of new stuff</a>. I suggested the ability to disable the XmlHttpRequest object and it looks like it's going to make the final version. He's done one better and he's going to add a feature that lets you watch the requests and responses! Holy crap! <a href="">Venkman</a> going to see a lot less action from this hombre.<br /><br />The biggest feature I can see is the "Edit HTML" function. It will allow you to edit the HTML of a rendered page in real-time and see the effects of your actions. It was huge for CSS and I think it's going to be incredible for HTML. <a href="http://mochikit.com/examples/interpreter/index.html">Real-time editing of Javascript</a> anyone?<br /><br />Worst case, you'll have to re-install the release version. Best case, you're rocking the free world!<br /><br /><br />

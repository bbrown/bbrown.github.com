<br />The new Firefox extension <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/piggy-bank/">Piggy Bank</a> sounds like a good idea. The Semantic Web is a grand vision that has altogether lacked a sufficient implementation. Piggy Bank is designed to bring the Semantic Web to sites whether they use it or not, kicking and screaming if necessary.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this implementation takes down Firefox. I would say kicking and screaming but it's more like puts Firefox down like Rohypnol. I was just working on a blog entry when I had to quit Firefox. It started putting up an hourglass just to get an image's properties. I looked in the Task Manager: 671MB and 55% CPU utilization for firefox.exe. Uh huh. I'll wait for the kinks to get worked out.<br /><br />Note to <a href="http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/89/">developer</a>: killer apps don't kill. It's just a figure of speech.<br /><br /><br />

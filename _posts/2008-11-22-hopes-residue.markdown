The students at an elementary school spontaneously <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/11/yes-we-can-stud.html">asked</a> for their school to be renamed Barack Obama Elementary School. At least, some fifth graders who held a mock debate and who came to a school board meeting to request the change. And then the school board unanimously and immediately accepted the change.

I can't say anything else about this. Do I comment about the sorry state of education, the deification of The One, or cynical manipulation of children? I'm at a loss.

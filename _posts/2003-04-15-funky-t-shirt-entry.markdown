<br />There are tons of funky t-shirts available on the Web.<br /><br />If you're an ardent breastfeeder, <a href="http://www.breastorbust.com/catalog1.htm" title="A little on the corny side for my tastes. Plus, I'm not an ardent breastfeeder.">BreastOrBust</a> has got apparel to flaunt your chosen baby-feeding method.<br /><br />If you're a geek, there's a ton of places to get shirts that signify your grokking of grepping. From the practically institutional <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/">ThinkGeek</a>&#x2014;my favorites are <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/coder/5d6a/">"There's no place like 127.0.0.1"</a> and <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/frustrations/38e2/">"I don't work here"</a>&#x2014;to <a href="http://www.computergear.com/funnyts.html">ComputerGear</a>&#x2014;I like <a href="http://www.computergear.com/1090-1.html">this one</a>&#x2014; to <a href="http://www.copyleft.net/thumbs.phtml?category_id=1">Copyleft</a>, computer geeks have a broad range of options.<br /><br />If you're confrontational and vulgar, the Web's got you covered too. <a href="http://vulgaritees.com/">Vulgaritees</a> is an obvious first place to visit, but you've definitely got to check out <a href="http://www.tshirtsthatsuck.com/ns/index.html">T-ShirtsThatSuck.com</a> if you're looking for something to get you thrown out of a mall.<br /><br />My personal favorite T-shirt site is <a href="http://www.freeworldtrading.com/">FreeWorldTrading.com</a>, which bills itself as "Radical T-Shirts for Rational Minds." Yep, that fits me to a T. *ba bum bum ching* *groan*<br /><br /><br />

<br />Looks like the <a href="http://www.bnlmusic.com/">Barenaked Ladies</a> are coming out with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000CC6QC/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link">new CD</a> on October 21st. Looks like it'll be available through "digital retailers" on October 14th. How cool is that!<br /><br /><br />

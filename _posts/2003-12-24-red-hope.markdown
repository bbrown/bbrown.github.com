<br />I'm hopeful that these <a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/asia/story/0,4386,226760,00.html">proposed</a> <a href="http://fpeng.peopledaily.com.cn/200312/23/eng20031223_131019.shtml">amendments</a> aren't mere words appended to an ersatz constitution. "Private property obtained legally shall not be violated" is a pretty good statement, though legally devoid of meaning without proper judicial interpretation. It's easy to think of how its meaning could be perverted (and subverted) by kangaroo courts with political motivations.<br /><br /><br />

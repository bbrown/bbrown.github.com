We're living in very interesting times. I think we're seeing a fundamental change in organizations as they move more and more towards knowledge work. Nothing matters more than value production&mdash;without it you will not have a revenue-generating business.
</p>
<p>
In the past when knowledge work was more rare, companies produced a physical good for sale or use as an input to other products. There was a tangible object that had some sort of utility to someone. The problem of a manufacturing company is distribution: how can I get this product into the hands of paying customers that want it. When organizing the employees of such a company, a rigid hierarchy works well because it generates efficiency. That leads to cost reductions, which translate into profits.
</p>
<p>
But in a knowledge organization, the fundamental problem is producing something of value. Since the product is intangible, anyone could generate it and you're fighting a human tendency to undervalue non-physical goods and services. There's a constant struggle to get customers to actually pay for your product; distribution has become trivial due to the Internet. Everyone in a knowledge-based company must be tied to value production as there's not much opportunity for cost savings since the inputs are typically mental. Efficiency comes from shedding non-producers.
</p>
<p>
This has implications for career development that are just starting to come to light. For example, <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/ashkenas/2012/03/your-career-needs-to-be-horizo.html">your career needs to be horizontal</a>. No longer must one climb the ladder to build a career. Sidesteps and expansion of responsibility without title changes are just as viable in a modern organization, if value production is the key. This makes you more valuable to the company.
</p>
<p>
And that's the path to a long, fruitful career.

My former boss&mdash;a mentor that presided over my entrance into management&mdash;recommended Jack Welch's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060753943/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="It's a good book and a super reference if you find yourself as CEO of a multibillion dollar international conglomerate."><cite>Winning</cite></a> and it really resonated with me. His injunction to "face reality, not as it was or as you wish it to be" is great business advice.
</p>
<p>
(It's similarly great advice on a personal level as well. Having a false sense of self leads to the erection of defense mechanisms like rationalization of ones foibles or flaws. At worst, it leads to evasion: the refusal to think.)
</p>
<p>
How many businesses or industries have failed because they didn't adapt to changing conditions. Wishing things were different is not a strategy: hope cannot pay dividends. The best businesses are ones that abandon unprofitable lines or innovate even in their dominant products.

At Go Daddy, our new CEO</a> recently covered this subject to great effect with his <a href="http://blakesblog.com/?p=13" title="'Below the table' is bad.">notion of "the table."</a> We were rightly proud of our positive traits, but we rarely discussed our negative aspects&mdash;the behaviors that were holding us back. So long as they remained "under the table" we could not and would not change them.
</p>
<p>
Bringing that up at the CEO level in a companywide Town Hall meeting was the best thing that could have happened. The future of the company has never been brighter and <a href="http://www.itsgodaddytime.com/" title="The end of the T&A campaigns is about two years late.">the latest marketing efforts</a> are but one example of that.

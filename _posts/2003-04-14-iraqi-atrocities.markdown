<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/opinion/11JORD.html">Absolutely repulsive</a>. I don't know what's worse, the brutalities committed by Hussein's regime or the fact that CNN knew about them but didn't report them. I wonder why they continued to use Iraqis as cameramen and translators when such usage constantly put them in jeopardy.<br /><br /><br />

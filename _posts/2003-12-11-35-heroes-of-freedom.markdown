<br /><a href="http://www.reason.com/"><cite>Reason</cite></a> just posted a list of <a href="http://www.reason.com/0312/cr.35.shtml">"35 heroes of freedom."</a> It's definitely the only list where you'll ever find Dennis Rodman listed after Ayn Rand outside of some alphabetical listing of celebrities. I think they could have easily pared it down to, oh, ten but they obviously needed to make 35 since it's their 35th anniversary of publication. I think the list was in earnest but it's disheartening to see the lightheartedness with which they approached such a weighty matter.<br /><br />It's also a resounding indictment of the libertarian circus tent methodology.<br /><br /><br />

Below is a list of Go Daddy employees who blog. I would have liked to register godaddybloggers.com, but I don't want to use a trademark if I can help it. Also, I know that I'm missing a bunch of people, so if you're not on this list and want to be (or just want me to read your blog) send me an email. You know how to find me on the directory. I'm going to list them alphabetically by last name for ease.

[LIST REDACTED BY REQUEST]

<p>
I intend to maintain this list. New blogs from the last update will be in bold.

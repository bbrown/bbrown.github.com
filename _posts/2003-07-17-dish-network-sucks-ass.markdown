<br />Okay, I'm nearing the finale of my months-long struggle to end my relationship with <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/what-a-freaking-day.cfm">Dish Network</a>. I just got off the phone with an assistant to the executive vice president (possibly my third or fourth call to this individual) and he says that one of his nitwit colleagues credited my account for the returned DishPVR but forgot to refund the money. Apparently, Dish Network's customer service system is so stupid that it can credit a long-closed account without triggering a refund and their people don't know about this oversight.<br /><br />If you've got Dish Network, enjoy it and don't ever try to cancel. They'll make you jump through every hoop they've got&#x2014;you'd think there was a subsidiary of EchoStar that made them. This saga started on April 30, 2003 and still is not resolved.<br /><br /><br />

<p id="announcement">
To those of my readers who are tired of reading my political writings, have hope! I am working on a new blog where I plan to do all of my political blogging. I will then try to keep bblog focused on computers, programming, and technology.
</p>
<p id="announcement-more-info">
The new blog will have a stable of Objectivist authors commenting on politics, society, and culture. I have high hopes for it. I'm still setting up the blogâ€”look for an announcement in the next week or so.

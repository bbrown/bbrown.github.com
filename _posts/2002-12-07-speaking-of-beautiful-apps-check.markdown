<br />Speaking of beautiful apps, check out <a href="http://www.mludi.net/YourSQL/">YourSQL</a>, the subject of a <a href="http://www.osdir.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=95&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=-1">recent review at OSDir.com</a>. This app is like Enterprise Manager for MySQL on Mac OS X. It's a Cocoa app and boasts all of the usual innovations that come with that framework. Best of all, it's completely free and the source can be obtained as well.<br /><br />Of course, there's always <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/">PHPmyAdmin</a> but this blows that web-based app away!<br /><br /><br />

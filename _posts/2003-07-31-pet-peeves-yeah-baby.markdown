<br />Watching <a href="http://www.theamazingracesucks.com/"><cite>The Amazing Race</cite></a> tonight, I realized that I had moved from dislike to sheer hatred of the phrase "Yeah, baby!" It came on the scene a year or two before <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6304696221/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Austin Powers</cite></a> completely ruined its novelty. If you say this (and you know who you are because you probably say a lot of these clich&#xE9; verbal crutches), please consider coming up with something new or, perhaps, ditch the crutches and banter on your own.<br /><br />If you think about it, its affirmatory power is neither a solid "Yes" and is tempered by the indiscriminate "Baby," normally reserved for infants or loved ones. If I have to use something like it, I'll go with a good ol' "Yes indeedy!" or "You bet your sweet bippy!"&#x2014;which has the added benefit of being inscrutable to everyone under the age of 30 and nostalgic to those over.<br /><br /><br />

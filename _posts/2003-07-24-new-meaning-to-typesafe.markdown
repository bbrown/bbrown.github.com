<br />Bizarre <a href="http://www.engagestudio.com/helvetica/">typeface game</a> done in Flash in which you smash Arial characters with Helvetica ones. I'm pretty sure that there's a message here, but the developers don't go into much detail. I personally find Arial abhorrent, but people in general use it way too much. It's a complete bastardization of Helvetica, but Helvetica isn't bundled with Windows. Thanks again, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>!<br /><br /><br />

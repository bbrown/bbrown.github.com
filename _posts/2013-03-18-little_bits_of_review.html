<p>
Here are some brief thoughts on what I've watched lately.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0036EH3WU/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Lost</cite></a>: I swore off <cite>Lost</cite> entirely after the series finale. I thought it was a terrible end to an outstanding television show. I decided back in January to re-visit the entire series and see if I still felt the same way. I don't. There are still a maddening number of unanswered questions, but I'm at peace with that and just enjoyed the amazing ride.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008G33O0G/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>The Cabin in the Woods</cite></a>: this is one of those great movies that are easily overlooked. I'm not going to describe anything about it because the less you know, the better. It's an amazing twist on the horror movie genre, like <cite>Scream</cite> ostensibly was only more clever.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005LAIH9A/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>American Reunion</cite></a>: I liked the earlier movies for what they were, but this was just terrible. It lacks any of the simple pleasures of the others, and it really felt forced.</li>
</ul>

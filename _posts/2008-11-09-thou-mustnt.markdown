"You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.<br />
You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.<br />
You cannot help little men by tearing down big men.<br />
You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer.<br />
You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich.<br />
You cannot establish sound security on borrowed money.<br />
You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred.<br />
You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn.<br />
You cannot build character and courage by destroying men's initiative and independence.<br />
And you cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they can and should do for themselves." &#x2013; William J.H. Boetcker, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._H._Boetcker"><cite>The Ten Cannots</cite>

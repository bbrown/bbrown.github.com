My prayers—such as they are—have been answered. I'm getting a Mac for
my desk for testing purposes. All you Mac Quick Blog users are going to

on Mac OS X and running Safari or OmniWeb). I would've preferred one of
the bitchin' new Quads but what are you gonna do?<p style="font-size:xx-small;">[The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]</p>

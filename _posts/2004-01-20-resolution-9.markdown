<br />The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596002815/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link">second edition of <cite>Learning Python</cite></a> is out and <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/01/20/176200">this review</a> of it over at Slashdot makes it sound really great. I've read <a href="http://diveintopython.org/">Dive into Python</a>, which I didn't care for at all, and several other <a href="http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/IntroductoryBooks">free, online books</a>. None of them really cut the mustard for me, so I'm thinking it might time to add <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lpython2/">the book</a> to my shopping cart at Amazon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't think that my work will get <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari</a> soon enough.<br /><br />[UPDATE: If you're not convinced of Python's utility, then here's <acronym title="Eric S. Raymond">ESR</acronym> to <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=3882">'splain it</a>.]<br /><br /><br />

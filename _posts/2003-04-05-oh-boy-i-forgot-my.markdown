<br />Oh boy. I forgot my power supply at work on Friday and my battery's only got an hour of juice left&#x2014;ach, 58 minutes! I've turned my screen brightness to as low as I can take, elevated Thor, my <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html" title="I've actually got the 500MHz model.">PowerBook G4</a>, so that the fan doesn't come on, and opened all my essential apps so I don't spin the hard drive too much. Suffice it to say, posting may be sporadic or non-existent this weekend unless I can make the thirty-minute drive to my work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'm working this morning and afternoon at my <a href="http://www.paintinginthepark.com/">pottery studio</a> and spending the rest of the day with my family. Tomorrow, though, I may go down to the <a href="http://www.azbookfestival.org/">Arizona Book Festival</a>&#x2014;held at the Carnegie Library&#x2014;and that event is fairly close to my work. If I can last that long!<br /><br />[UPDATE] CRAP! I just read that the Festival is only today. Arrgh. Maybe I'll alter my plans for today.<br /><br /><br />

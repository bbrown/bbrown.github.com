<p>I love it when a clich&#xE9; gets twisted up and acquires fresh life. I've come across this "remix" before, but it never fails to bring a smile: "Give a man a fire, and he'll be warm for a night. Set a man on fire, and he'll be warm for the rest of his life." It's obviously tongue-in-cheek and I couldn't find its originator anywhere online though it <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Give%20a%20man%20a%20fire%2C%20and%20he'll%20be%20warm%20for%20a%20night.%20Set%20a%20man%20on%20fire%2C%20and%20he'll%20be%20warm%20for%20the%20rest%20of%20his%20life.%22">shows up extensively</a>.</p>

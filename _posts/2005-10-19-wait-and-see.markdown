<br />One of the best things about this new blog product is that we had the <a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/archive/2005/09/28/Second_Movers_Advantage.aspx">second mover's advantage</a>. By that I mean that we could learn from the earlier competitors and make decisions informed by their experiences, not that we <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/HowSONYgottobegreatTheirphilosophywillenergizeanybusinessIuseitatGoDaddyItwillalsoworkforyout.html">aped the competition</a>.<br /><br />Having been a consumer of blogging technologies for years and years, it was incredible working on the blogging engine I've always wanted. It's not <em>exactly</em> as I had envisioned&#x2014;compromises must be made and sometimes, *gasp*, my vision was wrong&#x2014;but it's very, very close. The best part was getting to work on technologies that I previously had only been a consumer of; the feed wars, for example, were never fully real to me because I had always just used the provided templates.<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

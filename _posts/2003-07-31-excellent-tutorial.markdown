<br />Here's an excellent <a href="http://www.gethardcoresex.com/sex/cunnilingus/index.html">advanced tutorial</a> on <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/02/02mangus.phtml">Colonel Angus</a>. If you're a guy with a partner you love, you owe it to yourself (and your partner) to read through this. It's very well-written, descriptive enough to be useful, and thorough. There are illustrative pictures along the sides that are definitely not work safe, but don't let that stop you. Turn off images or resize to obscure them.<br /><br />Note: I've avoided the obvious descriptor words so that I don't get pervs for all eternity visiting my site. Also, I didn't stumble across this tutorial through any similarly perverted means: it came across the <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/new/">What's New on Yahoo!</a> pages this <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/new_additions/20030729/Society_and_Culture/" title="I don't know how it got categorized in Society &amp; Culture">Tuesday</a>.<br /><br /><br />

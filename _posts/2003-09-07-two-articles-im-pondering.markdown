<br />I'm reading <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/gershenfeld03/gershenfeld_index.html">two</a> <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/fame_vs_fortune.html">articles</a> right now on two very different subjects, but they've both got me thinking that they're related in some way. One is about personal fabrication of items and the other is about personal publishing. I came across them completely separately and coincidentally. It's rather strange actually, but such serendipity is commonplace on the Web.<br /><br /><br />

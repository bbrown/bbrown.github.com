<br />I don't mean to give the wrong impression with yesterday's blog entries. I think all of the stuff Jobs announced yesterday were completely <a href="http://hbsworkingknowledge.hbs.edu/pubitem.jhtml?id=3533&amp;t=innovation">pants-shitting goodness</a>. I am going to upgrade to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/panther/">Panther</a> when it becomes available and I am going to lust over the <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">PowerMac G5</a> every visit to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/biltmore/">Apple Store</a> until one day when it will be mine. Oh yes, it will be mine.<br /><br />I just think that there's some downsides to some of the decisions Apple/Steve Jobs have made.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I was eating lunch at Baja Fresh today, I had my usual nachos, and a pigeon walked up in its head-bobbing manner. Having an abundance of chips and feeling a beneficence for a fellow living creature&#x2014;abnormal for me, especially, because I can't stand pigeons and birds in general&#x2014;I broke up a chip and cast it near. He proceeded to break it further against the sidewalk for easier processing and digestion and I was hooked. I gave him about three full chips over the course of twenty minutes as I alternated between pigeon observation and reading a Python book on my laptop.<br /><br />That is, until a smaller bird, a sparrow perhaps, discovered the buffet. This bird had the audacity to scoop a large piece right out from in front of the pigeon, who was dutifully busting it up. The bird&#x2014;a third the size of the pigeon&#x2014;then flew away some distance to share the bounty with an avian friend. I was a little pissed at this thievery so I stepped up the pigeon's allocation. The bird's friend then swooped over to steal the new offering. WTF!<br /><br />This has renewed my disdain for pigeons, specifically, and birds, in general. What kind of creature lets another much less powerful creature take away its food? If I were that pigeon, there'd be some sparrow bits in the offerings I left on car windshields.<br /><br /><br />

<br />As you may know, I'm a big fan of <a href="/values/people/altonbrown.cfm">Alton Brown</a> and his show <cite>Good Eats</cite>. While archiving a bunch of shows to VHS tape from TiVO, I caught a particular formulation from his <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ea/episode/0,1976,FOOD_9956_20772,00.html">yogurt</a> show: froyo for frozen yogurt. For some reason, its cleverness and unexpectedness caught me off guard and cracked me up for a number of minutes.<br /><br /><br />

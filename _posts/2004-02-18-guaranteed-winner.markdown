<br /><a href="http://www.macmerc.com/">MacMerc</a> suggests a way to <a href="http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/1270">guarantee</a> an iTunes song with every Pepsi bottle you purchase. I wish someone would figure out how to do this for the 7-11 cups. I'm currently at 7 songs with 38 cups (18% win rate).<br /><br />[UPDATE: Tried it with a Sierra Mist and it worked well. If only I liked the taste of Pepsi or Sierra Mist. :-( Or if only the Mountain Dew-capped bottles weren't <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=2787677283&amp;category=171">so expensive</a>!]<br /><br />[UPDATE (2/19/04): <a href="http://www.appleturns.com/">As the Apple Turns</a> has a <a href="http://www.appleturns.com/scene/?id=4518">hilarious take</a> on tilting.]<br /><br /><br />

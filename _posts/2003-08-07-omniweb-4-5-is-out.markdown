<br />The final of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a> <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/gallery/">4.5</a> is <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/download/">out</a>! It's one sweet release and has been my default browser since an early sneaky peek.<br /><br />Why use OmniWeb instead of <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>? Did OmniWeb all of a sudden get tabs? Oh, young browser snake, there is more to a browser than tabs. Let's see: shortcuts, drawer-based bookmarks, subscriptions, download manager, page info, syntax coloring in view source, WebCore, image blocking, and so freaking much more. If OmniWeb had tabs, then I would declare it the ultimate browser. I hear that they're planned for 5.0.<br /><br />Color me waiting for 5.0!<br /><br />[UPDATE (8/8/03): The inevitable Slashdot discussion <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/08/153236&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=185">ensues</a>, attended by an <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=74053&amp;cid=6647760">OmniGroup employee</a> with CVS access. Someone else notes a difference between OmniWeb's and Safari's rendering of the opening quotation mark on <a href="http://www.happycog.com/lectures/dwws/">this page</a>. Sweet!]<br /><br /><br />

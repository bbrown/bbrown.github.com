It's not often that I find a movie that is irredeemable. Normally, I can eke out some pleasure or positive out of just about any movie. Strangely, I've encountered two utterly worthless movies in one week: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AP04FG/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</cite></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JNZU/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</cite></a>. I'll spare you a review of the former&#x2014;mostly because writing a review of one boring movie is enough.

I was truly looking forward to watching this movie because everyone that's told me about it has been positively effusive in describing its hilarity. And I loves the funny. I watched the movie to the end, hoping minute by minute that I would at last encounter something beyond raunchy, over-the-top drivel and being disappointed each time. I don't mind raunchy and over-the-top so long as it's not drivel. <cite>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</cite>, however, was not well-executed, completely unsubtle, and rarely clever.

The story&#x2014;and it's really a one-trick pony&#x2014;is about a guy named Andy who has not had sex at the ripe old age of 40. Some of his co-workers take it upon themselves to end his dry patch. Hilarity ensues. Or, rather, hilarity was supposed to ensue.

At every opportunity, the movie took the vulgar route&#x2014;the road sadly more travelled. It could have been a touching and funny look at the kind of guy that lives his whole life wanting but never knowing the touch of a woman. Instead, it revels in all the nerd and awkward geek stereotypes it can think of.

I hated this movie.

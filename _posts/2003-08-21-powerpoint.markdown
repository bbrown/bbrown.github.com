<br />I can't stand <a href="2003_05_18_diamonds.cfm#200333307">PowerPoint presentations</a>. <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/">Edward Tufte</a>, longtime PowerPoint critic, has written an <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/ppt2.html">article</a> in this month's <cite>Wired</cite> on his hatred of PowerPoint. The article is long on vitriol and tends towards the damning-the-tool-instead-of-the-user strain of argument, a form popularized by <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html">Jakob Nielsen</a>.<br /><br />I did like the line "Power Corrupts. PowerPoint Corrupts Absolutely." What would Acton think?<br /><br />[UPDATE (1/8/04): Don Norman has offered a <a href="http://www.sociablemedia.com/articles_norman.htm">reasonable counterpoint</a> to Tufte's arguments.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />I love the idea behind <a href="http://www.seamlesscity.com/" title="A long view of a small part of San Francisco">Seamless City</a>. I'm big into taking pictures; I especially love panoramics because they capture what is visible to a person rather than one particular scene that might encompass 45&#xB0; of the 360&#xB0; of life.<br /><br />The idea is very simple: take a continuous (and seamless) series of pictures of a city along a route. The execution is much, much more complex because a) the scope is ambitious&#x2014;to the tune of a <a href="http://www.seamlesscity.com/route.html">30-mile route</a>&#x2014;and b) the presentation is difficult&#x2014;luckily, the designers decided on a linear route and will probably not allow hypertextual non-linearity. I have half a mind to do this for Phoenix but three problems spring immediately to mind:<br /><br /><ol><br /><li>What 30 miles of Phoenix is particularly interesting?</li><br /><li>I'd have to get out of my car to take these pictures.</li><br /><li>I have a full-time job already and enough sideline ideas to occupy the rest of my life.</li><br /></ol><br /><br />So there you have it: enjoy San Francisco's treatment since you won't be seeing it in this town (at least from me, let me know if you are doing it on your own).<br /><br /><br />

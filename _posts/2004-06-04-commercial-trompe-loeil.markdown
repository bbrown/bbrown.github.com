<br />Two new commercials developments in technology and visual cognition debuted recently: <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,8764,58565,00.html">Nokia's Wave Messaging</a> {<a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/06/01/will_airtexting_blackberry_become_the_mobile_hecklebot.html">via</a>} and <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific_business/view/88188/1/.html">subway ads</a> in Japan {<a href="http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/cultofmac/index.blog?entry_id=330737">via</a>}. Both rely on visual tricks to display information in unique ways. I particularly like the elegance and utility of the latter, since subway tunnels are underused and the ads rely solely on the subway's motion for the effect.<br /><br /><br />

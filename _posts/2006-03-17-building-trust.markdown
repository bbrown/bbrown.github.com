<p>The other day I was at the neighborhood <a href="http://www.quiktrip.com/">QuikTrip</a> and I got $5 over on my transaction. The next day at work I went to use the money but it wasn't there. It seems that the QT cashier neglected to give me the money. I'm sure something like this has happened to you before.</p>
<p>After work, I stopped by the store and told the manager Jim of my problem. Without a further question, he popped over to the nearest register, opened it up, and handed me a sawbuck. I was flabbergasted. I'm pretty sure it had something to do with the fact that I go there once or twice a day but I was still very impressed at the customer service.</p>

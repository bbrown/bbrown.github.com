In the course of preparing <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/archives/2007/03/baby-got-hacked">this entry</a> for <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/">Found on the Web</a>, I came across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lLRBiEBRAc">this video</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/aleprechaun">aleprechaun</a> AKA <a href="http://www.myspace.com/aleprechaun">Emily</a>. I'm hooked!
</p>
<p>
I'm still trying to decide what about her, the dancing, and the video is the most endearing. Young woman dancing in front of her computer to some music is a YouTube archetype, but I normally just shake my head in disgust at most of the examples I've come across. This one has me watching over and over&#x2014;something I haven't done with YouTube since the <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/archives/2006/05/mascot-joy">DJ Format videos</a>. So I had to introspect to see what I was responding to.
</p>
<p>
My first thought, naturally, was that I found her attractive. She's quite pretty and reminds me a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Fey">Tina Fey</a>. Furthermore, she's got a gangliness that I like. But that's not it.
</p>
<p>
Next I thought about the choreography, such as it is. I enjoyed that aspect but in the end it's not all that compelling. It's mostly just pantomiming the song's lyrics, which is quite uninspired. In a similar fashion, I dismissed my love for that song, which is <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/archives/2006/04/code-monkey-love">considerable</a>, as a rationale.
</p>
<p>
Then it hit me. The setting is such an integral part of her videos: it's so obviously a college dorm room. When I went to college, I lived and worked off-campus. Plus, I was married. So I never got to experience the collegial aspect of dorm living. In my mind, I always pictured college life like that video&#x2014;just goofing off and unwinding after a long day of studying. I bet that sort of thing goes on all the time in an average dormitory. Maybe it's not the case, but that's what it's like in my imagination.
</p>
<p>
It also speaks to youth, to joyful exuberance, to feeling like you "gotta dance." There are times in my own life, when I'm alone, where I just get down because I can't keep it in any longer. I'm a horrible dancer, which is why I can't do it in front of people, but the feeling's there all the same. Anyone that knows me is probably agape right now&#x2014;it's not a side of me that anyone but my immediate family has ever seen.
</p>
<p>
And maybe that's exactly what aleprechaun was doing, except that she recorded it and made it available to the world.

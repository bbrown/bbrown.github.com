<br />I want to learn how to cook. So, in my usual geeky way, I've been delving into the science behind cooking and watching every bit of <a href="/values/people/altonbrown.cfm">Alton Brown</a> I can. (Thanks, TiVo!)<br /><br />My exploration of the science of cooking has been greatly aided by Harold McGee's wonderful tomes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684181320/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>On Food and Cooking</cite></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0020098014/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>The Curious Cook</cite></a>. Both of these mammoth books cover food science, history, and culture in a very accessible way. I'd recommend them as a useful adjunct to <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ea/0,1976,FOOD_9956,00.html"><cite>Good Eats</cite></a>.<br /><br />However, they're tightly packed&#x2014;684 and 352 pages, respectively&#x2014;and that means that not that many people are willing to trudge through them. With that in mind, shows like <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/">Alton</a>'s and museum's like the <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/">Exploratorium</a> distill them into more edible chunks&#x2014;pun intended.<br /><br />The museum's <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/">Science of Cooking</a> exhibit does a good job at the task. Since I've read the McGee's chapter on eggs, I can comment on their <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/eggs/eggscience.html">egg page</a>. My evaluation: good coverage, lacks some depth that McGee's 40+ page chapter explored. What did I expect? I mean, come on!<br /><br /><br />

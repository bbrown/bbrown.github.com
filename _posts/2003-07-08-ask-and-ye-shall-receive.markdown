<br />Awhile back, I <a href="2003_06_29_diamonds.cfm#105708877619108589">recommended</a> an application called <a href="http://www.arcaneware.com/library/">Library 1.0</a> for book cataloging. I said that paying my shareware fee of $10 would help with future development and that said development would hopefully fill out the features it lacked. I even sent the developer an email suggesting the features that I would like to see.<br /><br />Today, ArcaneWare released <a href="http://www.arcaneware.com/library/whatsnew.html">Library 1.1</a>. The new <a href="http://www.arcaneware.com/library/library.dmg">310k download</a> offers everything I wanted and more! It's like the developer fulfilled all of my feature requests. I don't suppose he did because he never responded to my email, but I don't care all the same. The batch ISBN entry and text file import are worth the $10 fee alone. The <a href="http://www.arcaneware.com/books/">HTML export</a> is clean and simple&#x2014;it's not XHTML by any stretch of the imagination, but hopefully it's customizable.<br /><br />In related news, I'm up to 106 books cataloged. Admittedly, I haven't been putting a lot of energy into it.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I've found some <a href="http://www.maya.com/web/what/mayapinions/what_mp_gould_evilgenius.mtml">more</a> <a href="http://www.penmachine.com/techie/presentations_2003-12.html">articles</a> on the perils of PowerPoint. The first one has an interesting idea of using pictures in your presentations with very little text and then working off the pictures in your speech. I like it, though I think it would get <strong>really</strong> tiresome if it became a prevalent form.<br /><br /><br />

<br />Phew! I've been hacking away at this site's code off and on all day. Now I'm sitting here watching TV and hacking still more. What's coming up on this site?<br /><br />Well, I'm developing an entire administrative section for the site that will allow me to update just about any section through a web interface instead of having to drop into <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> and <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> everything up to the server. Making everything editable through the web browser will also have additional benefits: I'll be able to repurpose content left and right to make it more interesting and I'll be able to offer all of the content in multiple formats for easy consumption by anyone and anything. More importantly, though, it will make it easier to <em>add</em> content.<br /><br />And around these parts, content is king.<br /><br /><br />

"It's not the proper role of government to prop up stocks, housing or any other market. Yet like the vaudeville performer on the old Ed Sullivan show, politicians now see their duty as to keep the plates spinning just a few more months, maintaining constituents in their homes and jobs at least until after the elections, without any thought to the long-term cost being paid to do so."

"What Americans don't get, however, is that the goal of the bill isn&#x2019;t to help Wall Street or Main Street, but to centralize power in Washington. Not surprisingly, that's where its biggest proponents just happen to reside." &#x2013; Jonathan Hoenig <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/stocks/politicians-use-bailout-to-grab-more-power/">"Politicians Use Bailout to Grab More Power"</a>

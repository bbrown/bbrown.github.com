<br />I just got done reading a <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/"><cite>JavaWorld</cite></a> <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-07-2003/jw-0711-jedit_p.html">review</a> of <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a>, a open-source, Java-based IDE. I've been using it for a long time now and I swear by it. Why? First, it's free. Second, it is amazing in the breadth of its features. Third, I can use the same version set up exactly the same way on both Mac OS X and Windows. Fourth, it has the best source code editor I have ever come across. Finally, it is being actively developed.<br /><br />I used to use <a href="">ColdFusion Studio</a>&#x2014;link goes to Macromedia HomeSite's product page because Macromedia end-of-lifed CF Studio and because the two programs share a common base&#x2014;but it was always so slow, static, and Windows-only. After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>The Pragmatic Programmer</cite></a>'s admonition to find an editor you like and learn everything there is to know about it, I decided that all of the switching between Windows and Macintosh and using different editors had to change. Then and there I started looking for an editor that suited my needs, had a bright outlook, and worked on both platforms.<br /><br />I quickly whittled my options down to jEdit and emacs. It really wasn't a difficult decision in the end because jEdit <a href="http://www.joshuasmiller.com/jedit/">looks and feels</a> like ColdFusion Studio&#x2014;the environment I programmatically grew up in. That was good ol' jEdit 3.2 and jEdit's currently in the beta stage for 4.2. It's come a very long way. Reviewing the <a href="http://jedit.org/index.php?page=features">feature set</a> gives but a glimpse of the editor's power.<br /><br />For the record, I've tried <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> but it doesn't really work for me since I'm not a Java guy yet. I primarily edit HTML and ColdFusion files with a smattering of Java files while I'm learning the language. HTML and ColdFusion files don't really follow a project-based idiom and so I didn't feel comfortable in that environment. Once I get my Java legs, then I'll definitely re-evaluate Eclipse since I've read a ton of people who think it's manna.<br /><br />Also, the <cite>JavaWorld</cite> review offers up some good reasons <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-07-2003/jw-0711-jedit_p.html#sidebar1">why jEdit is better than Eclipse or NetBeans</a>, illustrates some ways to use jEdit to support <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">extreme programming</a>, and explains jEdit's plugin architecture. It's a pretty good review, but it doesn't begin to describe its text editing features. You'll have to try those out for yourself.<br /><br />[UPDATE (7/21/03): Interesting <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/21/1558217&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=108&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=156">review</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1930110960/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Eclipse in Action</cite></a> over at Slashdot.]<br /><br /><br />

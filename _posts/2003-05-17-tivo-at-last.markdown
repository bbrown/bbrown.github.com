<br />The guys from <a href="http://www.directv.com/">DirecTV</a>&#x2014;actually Ironwood Communications (no link), a subcontractor&#x2014;are here and they're getting me hooked up. The <a href="http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/imagine/TIVO.jsp">TiVO unit</a> looks breathtaking: resplendent in shiny, silvery goodness with more hookups on its back than the humans in <cite>The Matrix</cite>. The installers are really nice&#x2014;complimented me on my house's smell&#x2014;and they're giving me an upgraded dish that can output four different signals and is ready for <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/hdtv.htm"><acronym title="High Definition TeleVision">HDTV</acronym></a> should I ever decide to upgrade my <acronym title="Television">TV</acronym>.<br /><br />Regrettably, I'm going to be out of town next week and I have to work later tonight for a <acronym title="Storage Area Network">SAN</acronym> outage, so I'm going to have limited TiVO time until then. If any of you readers has any special features or tricks that I should know about (or links to the same), I'd really appreciate it if you'd <a href="/contact/?subject=TiVO+Tips">send them to me</a>.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I don't normally write about <a href="http://www.perversiontracker.com/">PerversionTracker</a>, the parody site of <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/">VersionTracker</a> dedicated to stupidly-conceived software. There's just too much good stuff there. I could easily do a blog whose sole content is commentary about PerversionTracker and <a href="http://www.theonion.com/"><cite>The Onion</cite></a>.<br /><br />This entry about the program <a href="http://perversiontracker.com/archives/000244.html">Dead or Alive 1.0</a> is too funny, though, so I had to blog it. The idea behind the program&#x2014;notification of the death of tracked people&#x2014;is both weird and ill-conceived. If that special someone has passed on, the musical alert is <cite>Bye, Bye Love</cite>. You couldn't make this stuff up!<br /><br /><br />

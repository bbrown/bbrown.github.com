<p>Also known as "Orangenfruchtsaftlimonade," this fruit-based soda is hard to pin down. There's definitely hints of a lemonade, but the carbonation and other fruit juices muddy the waters so to speak. No aftertaste, pleasant taste, but missing something that would rate it higher. I would drink it again, but this doesn't have me suggesting it to anyone I approach.

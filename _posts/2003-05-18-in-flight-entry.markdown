<br />I'm currently writing this while flying high (35,000 feet) over Nevada <em>en route</em> to Portland, Oregon for some training. I'm also listening to <a href="http://www.superchick.net/">Superchic[k]</a> on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/" title="Mine's of the old variety. You know, from December 2002...">iPod</a>.<br /><br />I'm busily annotating my <a href="/links/daily.cfm">recommended daily links</a>, something I had never really planned on doing because it seemed like such a waste of time for little return. However, there's something different about flying: it feels like doing that is more productive than just sitting here listening to my <acronym title="Advanced Audio Codec">AACs</acronym>. I don't know how many I'll get through since this is only a three-hour flight&#x2014;and I'm sucking down complimentary <acronym title="Orange Juice">OJ</acronym> like crazy so I anticipate that some of that three hours will be in the first-class john.<br /><br /><br />

<p>Slashdot is <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/linux/06/03/23/008229.shtml">abuzz</a> about the story that Go Daddy has moved to Windows from Linux. The comments range from frothy to dismissive. The latter is the appropriate response because the move was only for parked domains. Go Daddy still offers up Linux hosting of all stripes and many of our applications run in Linux environments. These parked domain pages have *zero* customer interaction.</p>
<p>Nothing to see here, move along.</p>
<p>[UPDATE: Oh yeah, the good news to come from this is that <a href="">Quick Blog</a> got a nod in the <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060321/sftu089.html">press release</a>. Okay, so it's not a huge mention but no other application got so recognized.]

I finally got my personalized license plate! I've never had one before in my 16 years of driving mostly because I couldn't afford it and I regarded them as frivolous. Now I can certainly afford it and it seems <em>de rigueur</em> for MINI Coopers.

I wrestled with a bunch of them including "101BAHN", "1012XDY", and "QCKBLOG". But none of them were really me (except "QCKBLOG", that is). I do C#, so that's what I went with.

<br />When I first heard of David Blaine's, well, idiotic cry for help, I asked who was paying for this <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=%22david+blaine%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search">pathetic display</a>. I never got an answer until I read this <a href="http://www.plastic.com/article.html;sid=03/09/20/21124230">article</a> at <a href="http://www.plastic.com/">Plastic</a>. For the record, I think Blaine's "magic" is no worse than David Copperfield's or any of the other retarded impossibilities broadcast in TV specials over the years.<br /><br /><br />

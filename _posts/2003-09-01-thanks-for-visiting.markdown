<br />August's results are in and traffic is almost double July's and three times what it was in April&#x2014;I'm not even including the RSS feed traffic in those totals either. I don't know if the traffic surge is because of more frequent blogging, more essays, or what.<br /><br />I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for visiting. I'd love to know if there's anything you'd like to see added or done differently. Leave a comment or send me an <a href="/contact/?subject=Site+Suggestion">email</a>. I'll consider anything, but I'd especially like to know what makes you come back.<br /><br /><br />

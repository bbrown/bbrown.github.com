<br /><img src="http://www.bbrown.info/images/blog/searchterms.gif" alt="Pie graph showing search terms 'trading spaces lawsuit' in top position" class="blogimage" />Is it pathetic that the vast majority of search terms are to an obscure page containg a posting about <a href="http://www.bbrown.info/blogs/bblog/2002_12_15_diamonds.cfm" title="Like this post is going to help anything!"><cite>Trading Spaces</cite></a>?<br /><br />You'll notice that I don't include any real data. If I did that, you would see how low traffic this site really is. As opposed to the imperious Bill Brown Information Center it purports to be. Or you might see how few people are really looking for information about Bill Brown. In other words, this site is mainly for my benefit, secondarily for any readers, and finally for posterity.<br /><br /><br />

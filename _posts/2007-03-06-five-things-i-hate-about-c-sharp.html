<p>Inspired by <a href="http://use.perl.org/%7Ebrian_d_foy/journal/32556">Brian D. Foy's entry</a> and <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/mar-07/five-things-I-hate-about-python">Titus Brown's one for Python</a>, here are five things I hate about C#:</p><ol><li>You can't have methods whose signatures differ only in their return values. I think I understand why it might not have been a good idea in the past, but with VisualStudio.NET I don't see how anyone could get confused any longer.</li><li>You can split a class into partial classes. Why you'd want to do that is beyond me. Luckily, it's a 2.0 thing so I was able to refrain from seeing it for most of my development life.</li><li><code>virtual</code>. I hate how you have to explicitly state which methods can be overridden by descendents.</li><li>Constructor chaining. I wish it could be done like normal method overloading where you can have the constructor do something and then call another constructor. Again, I understand why that's not feasible since the <acronym title="Common Language Runtime">CLR</acronym> would have to divine when a constructor was being called by another constructor versus a normal call to limit object creation. But the way that it's handled currently obscures what's actually happening when it treats the called constructor as a sort of pass-through to another one.</li><li>Documentation. This appears to be a universal language complaint. <acronym title="MicroSoft Developer's Network">MSDN</acronym> is quite comprehensive but shallow at the same time. Everything is minimally documented and I can generally start there. But I can almost never end there: I invariably have to go to places like <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">CodeProject</a> in order to get a decent example of the syntax in action. Even that is generally not the final word because I usually then have to go to the blogs to see if there's any "gotchas" involved in using the language construct. Oh, and MSDN does a <em>horrible</em> job of differentiating between .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0--something I desperately need because I'm currently working in both versions of the framework.</li></ol><p>That was a lot tougher than I thought. I had to comb through the code to find things that I hated that were specifically C# and not ASP.NET. C# is really quite a lovely language. In general, it's the <a href="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/archives/001881.html">bee's pajamas</a>.</p><p>Just for grins, here's five things I hate about ASP.NET:</p><ol><li>WebControls. Yes, I generally can't stand WebControls. I'm quite obsessive about my HTML and CSS; a lot of that combination's power is stripped away when you use a WebControl because Microsoft makes a lot of assumptions about how you're going to be using them.</li><li>AutoEventWireup defaults to true in 2.0. Okay, so I <a href="http://bbrown.info/2007/03/02/full-auto.aspx">just talked</a> about this one</li> but it's so wrong to change the default like that.<li>Application event lifecycle. There's really no adequate documentation about the ASP.NET sequence of events. This <a href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/20030211.asp">article</a> from Peter Bromberg was the best I found. I ended up spending a lot of time in debugging trying to determine what is available when in the event sequence.</li><li>I hate ViewState. It is nothing but massive bloat and there's almost always a better way of storing data. I've also had several utterly inexplicable errors caused by ViewState corruption or changing.</li><li>PostBack. There's a reason why the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag has an <code>action</code> attribute, Microsoft. I know that the Javascript trickery involved in POSTing to the same page allows for some nice automagical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box">black-boxing</a>. I just don't like that model of Web application development.</li></ol><p>That one was a whole lot easier. I had to limit myself to just five. <img src="http://bbrown.info/emoticons/smile.png" border="0"/></p>

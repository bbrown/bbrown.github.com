<p>
Watching the <cite>Lost</cite> season finale, I got excited by a couple new reality shows: <a href="http://abc.go.com/summer/wipeout/index"><cite>Wipeout</cite></a> and <a href="http://abc.go.com/summer/isurvivedajapanesegame/index"><cite>I Survived a Japanese Game Show</cite></a>. The latter reminds me of <a href="http://www.milkandcookies.com/link/64364/detail/">an episode</a> of <cite>The Simpsons</cite> and the former looks like a rip-off of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MXC"><cite>Most Extreme Elimination Challenge</cite></a>. They're both right up my alley.

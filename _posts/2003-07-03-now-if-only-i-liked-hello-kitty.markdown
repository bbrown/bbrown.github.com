<br />From <a href="http://www.markme.com/cantrell/">Christian Cantrell</a>, I see that Sanyo makes a <a href="http://store.sanyousa.com/osb/itemdetails.cfm/ID/5">Hello Kitty toaster</a>. The best feature is that it toasts Hello Kitty onto every piece of toast you make. If only I liked Hello Kitty or could eat toast...I wonder if there's any other toast imprinting options out there.<br /><br /><br />

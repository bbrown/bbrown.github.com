<br />I'm not a big fan of Donald Trump. Oh sure, he's a repeat self-made billionaire and that definitely earns him some respect in my book. However, his crass, self-serving schtick leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I realize that it got him where he is today, but it's decidedly <em>not</em> my style.<br /><br />That said, I am glad for his <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7832944/">outspokenness</a>. The <a href="http://www.renewnyc.com/plan_des_dev/wtc_site/new_design_plans/Freedom_Tower/freedom_tower_dec_19.asp">Freedom Tower design</a> is really, really bad. It's a shadow of the former World Trade Center and that sends exactly the wrong message. "Please, terrorists, this one isn't worth destroying."<br /><br />The right thing to do would be to erect something bigger and better, a double middle finger for the New York skyline. Trump is right about the difficulty of renting space in the new building, but he's also right that that is inevitable no matter which building is on the site. So he's <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5445086/">fighting</a> for the <a href="http://www.makenynyagain.com/">right design</a>.<br /><br />It's nice to hear someone doing the right thing. And I applaud Donald Trump for that!<br /><br /><br />

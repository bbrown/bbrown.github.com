<br />Kevin Maney's columns are normally a little too flippant for my tastes, but his <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2003-04-08-maney_x.htm">most recent one</a> featured this gem:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />The prince used to own a minority chunk of the old Iridium in partnership with the Saudi Binladen Group, the company run by Osama bin Laden's family. So in a way, some of the money that gave a start to the world's most notorious terrorist partly funded a communications system helping the U.S. military blast Saddam's army. Now that's globalization.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I bet he was slapping himself on the back over that formulation. I know I would be.<br /><br /><br />

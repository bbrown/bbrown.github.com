<p>This bottle drew me in. First, the name was kind of weird and different from all other Dr. Brown's flavors. As I read the label more closely, I saw the words "celery soda" and knew that I just had to try this. Really, how often can you try out a soda pop made with celery? It's an uncola that's like Sprite without the sweetness or a ginger ale without the harsh taste. The celery is not overpowering, but you can definitely taste it. No aftertaste though the celery does make a re-appearance in belches.

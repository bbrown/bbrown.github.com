<br />We're in the home stretch for the new blog product. The good news is that there will be a free and paid version so all of you readers that don't want to shell out the dough can try it out first. The bad news is that, umm, well, there is no bad news. I can't wait to get this out the door so a) I can talk about it and b) I can get to work on all the awesome features we've got planned for future releases. It's fun working on 1.0 but every developer likes features more than fixes.<br /><br />All I can say is that this thing is going to be huge. Really big time.<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

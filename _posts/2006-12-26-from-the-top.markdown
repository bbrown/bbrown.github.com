One of the best things about working at Go Daddy is that our CEO doesn't do <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/12/22/how_to_kill_a_p">this kind of pussy-footing</a>. I know I'd rather have someone at the top that occasionally puts his foot in his mouth than one that speaks in <a href="https://www.desertschools.org/dsfcu/ds/fromThePresident/0,1665,1,00.html" title="My last employer">boring platitudes</a>. And I'm sure that that personality has brought more customers into the Go Daddy fold than it has driven away.

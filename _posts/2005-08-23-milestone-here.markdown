<br />This entry is the 1,000th one I've written. There's actually only 997 available on the Web: I've got three draft entries waiting to be finished. There's a review of Nevil Shute's <cite>Pied Piper</cite>, an analysis of <a href="http://www.quiktrip.com/">QuikTrip</a>'s severely broken queueing system, and an essay on public history in the Internet age. The latter is completely done, but its tone is a little more strident than I'd like. Each will appear here eventually, so I'm counting them in my total.<br /><br />This is a very important milestone to me&#x2014;perhaps even more important than the <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/milestone-elsewhere.cfm">Found on the Web one</a>&#x2014;because these entries are typically longer, more thoughtful, and represent more of my personality than those over there. Here, you get to know the real me: my thoughts, my desires, my being. There you might get to see what makes me laugh, makes me exclaim, makes me shake my head.<br /><br />I'm also happy to report that I have not wavered from my stated <a href="/blogs/policy.cfm">policies</a> except for the fact that Go Daddy allows for blogging about work.<br /><br />Here's to the next thousand entries! May I somewhere in there finally get around to moving my entire site over to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?wcbrown">Dreamhost</a> and <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a>.<br /><br /><br />

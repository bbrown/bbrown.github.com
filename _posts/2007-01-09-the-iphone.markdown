That <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> is hot. Buried among the announcements was a name change to Apple, Inc. from Apple Computer, Inc. and the playing of a Beatles song. As <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=215930&amp;cid=17526076">this Slashdot commenter</a> noted, the long-standing troubles with Apple Records must finally be over. It's not a press release, but it's awfully close.

Also, I sure hope they have some more special events this month or next detailing the changes to Mac OS X and announcing the <a href="http://media-newswire.com/release_1040819.html">new eight-ways</a>. The keynote was long but it focused solely on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/" title="Is it just me or should they have reserved that for a branded high-def TV?">AppleTV</a> and the iPhone. It's hard to call this the year of the Mac when the keynote was about anything but.

[UPDATE: One other thing I noticed was the June 2007 availability. A lot of people are puzzled by this because FCC compliance certification wouldn't take five months&#x2014;most people say it might take two months at the most. Watching the <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/j47d52oo/event/">introduction</a>, it dawned on me that this baby's going to run <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/" title="AKA 10.5">Leopard</a> and it probably won't be available much earlier than that.]

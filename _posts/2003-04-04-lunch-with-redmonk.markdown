<br /><a href="http://www.redmonk.net/"><img src="/images/blog/steve.jpg" width="" height="" alt="Steve Ivy aka Redmonk" border="0" align="left" style="padding-right:15px;" /></a> Hi, I'm Steve Ivy and I just ate a meatloaf wrapped in pizza crust. This smile is a post-Oregano's grin. By the way, go to <a href="http://www.blogshares.com/">BlogShares</a> and bid on me.<br /><br />Just kidding. I had lunch with Steve Ivy of <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic" title="Good blog..">Redmonk blog</a> fame. We had a pretty freewheeling discussion, but the outcome was that I am now convinced that <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> is my next order of business. He's a nice guy and I look forward to future lunch meetings and maybe some sort of collaboration.<br /><br /><br /><br />

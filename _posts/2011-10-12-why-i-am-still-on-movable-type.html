After leaving Blogger <a href="/2005/08/milestone-elsewhere.html">years and years ago</a>, I tried many different blogging engines (even developing <a href="/2007/07/sweet-release.html">my own</a>, so to speak). None of them were as safe as my old way of just FTPing HTML files up to my host. Movable Type was the closest since it generated HTML files&mdash;it was like a hosted version of Blogger.

The downside was (and still is) that it runs on Perl. I'm not a PHP developer by any stretch, but I can fend for myself in WordPress when I have a task in mind. Perl, though, is just inscrutable to me; I don't have time to learn it and what little I have read doesn't make sense.

So why stick with it, especially in light of the <a href="/2011/10/malware-done-got-me.html">recent malware attack</a>? I briefly toyed with Textpattern last night but the thought of redoing my blog, site, and essays in yet another CMS left me stone cold. I've been down <a href="/2005/02/pattern-of-procrastination.html">this road</a> before and I just don't have time for it any more.
</p>
<p>
I've got so many other better things than to endlessly tweak my Web site. Perhaps I've matured in that regard. Or maybe part of maturity and wisdom is a jaded fatigue with youth's flitting.

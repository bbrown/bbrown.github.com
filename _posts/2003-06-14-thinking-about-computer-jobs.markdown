<br /><a href="http://www.mindview.net/">Bruce Eckel</a>'s blog <a href="http://mindview.net/WebLog/">Thinking about Computing</a> has a great post about <a href="http://mindview.net/WebLog/log-0032">computer jobs</a> that everyone should read.<br /><br />It covers the current computer job market, why computer programmer numbers are overstated, the importance of business plans, and distance learning. Quite a pregnant post and you may even have to read it twice.<br /><br />Also, if you're not subscribed to his <a href="http://mindview.net/WebLog/RSS.xml">RSS feed</a>, you're missing out.<br /><br /><br />

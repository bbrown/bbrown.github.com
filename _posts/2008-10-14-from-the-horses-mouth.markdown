"It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance for success too. My attitude is that if the economy's good for folks from the bottom up, it's gonna be good for everybody â€¦ I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody." &#x2013; Barack Obama, <a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/13/obama-plumber-plan-spread-wealth/">Response to a Plumber</a>

[UPDATE (10/16/2008): Uh oh, McCain and Obama talked about Joe (the plumber above) and now the liberal goon squad is all over him: <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/1008/Joe_the_Plumber_No_new_taxes__and_no_old_oneseither.html">he's had a tax lien</a>, <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/10/16/95127/280/275/632293">he's a registered Republican and probably a plant</a>, <a href="http://www.raisingkaine.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=16680">he's a racist</a>, <a href="http://www.rumproast.com/index.php/site/comments/joe_the_plumber_flushes_credibility_down_the_shitter/">he's a nutjob</a>, <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2008/10/16/the-plumber/">he's lying</a>. The message is "dare to question The One publicly and you'll get people around the country digging into your past to post online." It's so disgusting and I see it often among liberals, who revel in finding and airing dirty laundry about their opponents.]

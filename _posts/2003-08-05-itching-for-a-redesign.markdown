<br />After seeing this awesome <a href="http://positioniseverything.net/guests/3colcomplex.html">cross-browser, cross-platform, tableless, three-column layout tutorial</a> and its <a href="http://positioniseverything.net/guests/3colcomplexside.html">liquid brother</a>, I'll confess to a serious itch to redesign my layout. Must. Resist. Urge. To. Scratch.<br /><br />It's funny how a two weeks ago I wouldn't have an eyelash about redesigning. I feel like I'm back in my ol' pottery studio days with no free time. The sample chapter required for my proposal is progressing steadily, I just may make my Friday deadline and be able to squeeze in a single editing round (in addition to the ruthless and generally poorly regarded constant self-editing I am doing).<br /><br /><br />

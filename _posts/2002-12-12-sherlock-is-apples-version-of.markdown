<br /><a href="http://www.apple.com/sherlock/">Sherlock</a> is <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>'s version of <a href="http://www.karelia.com/watson/">Watson</a>. Recently, Apple made the Sherlock SDK available and everyone's wondering where all the newfangled channels are.<br /><br />Enter <a href="http://www.sherlockers.com/">Sherlockers</a>. The site's <a href="http://www.sherlockers.com/channels.phtml">channel list</a> looks awesome and I can't wait for more. I just wish Sherlock was as good as Watson. Apple should have just licensed the technology. Oh well.<br /><br /><br />

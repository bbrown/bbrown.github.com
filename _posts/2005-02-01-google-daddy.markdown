<br /><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> is <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/31/2316212">now</a> a domain registrar. Given Google's history of <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">making</a> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">inexpensive</a> <a href="http://www.picasa.com/">things</a> free, this doesn't bode well for current domain registrars.<br /><br />On the other hand, <a href="http://www.netsol.com" rel="nofollow">Network Solutions</a> is still the top domain regisrar even though it charges four times what <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> does. It's probable that there's enough domain registrations to go around, but a free domain registration is a different proposition than a reduced-cost registration. The introduction of any cost to a transaction automatically limits the number of people and the <a href="http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/history/netscape.htm">removal</a> of any cost tends to reduce the prices of competitors (and drive them out of business if they can't compete).<br /><br />Google is <em>definitely</em> the company to watch in the Web world. It's the Southwest Airlines of the Internet.<br /><br /><br />

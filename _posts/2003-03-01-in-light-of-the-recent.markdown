<br />In light of the recent 12:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. work session after a full day of work and before having to get up to open the <a href="http://www.paintinginthepark.com/">pottery studio</a>, I think it's appropriate to share one of my favorite poems by one of my favorite poets:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.americanpoems.com/poets/ednamillay/midnightoil.shtml">"Midnight Oil" by Edna St. Vincent Millay</a><br /><br /><br />

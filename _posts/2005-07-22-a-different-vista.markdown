<br />No more <a href="">Longhorn</a>. The new release of Windows, due in third quarter 2015, will be called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/jul05/07-22LHMA.mspx">Windows Vista</a>. So the product name will be Microsoft Windows Vista. Hate it.<br /><br />[UPDATE (7/25/2005): Uh oh, looks like someone <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2140286/cloud-microsoft-vista">didn't do their homework</a>. I don't know how such a glaring oversight could occur. You'd only have to look at <strike>Phoenix</strike><strike>Firebird</strike>Firefox's cautionary tale. I mean, we're talking about <a href="http://www.vista.com/"><strong>Vista.com</strong></a> for crying out loud <em>and they're based in Redmond, Washington</em>.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (7/28/2005): Paul Thurrott <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/winvista_beta1_01.asp">reviews the Vista Beta 1</a>. Looking at the screenshots he provides, I'm surprised at how different Vista looks from XP. He points out its flaws and does a very thorough job of examining it. Luckily, it seems as boneheaded as XP so 10.5 should blow it out of the water in the months prior to Vista's release.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />Stumbled across <a href="http://www.walmartstores.com/wmstore/wmstores/Mainabout.jsp?pagetype=about&amp;categoryOID=-8992&amp;subCatOID=-8995&amp;template=DisplayAllContents.jsp">Sam's Rules for Building a Business</a> over at <a href="http://www.walmart.com/">Wal-Mart.com</a> today. It's a distillation of the wisdom offered up in Sam Walton's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553562835/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Made in America</cite></a>, which I haven't read or purchased though I will. I love Wal-Mart as a business, though I rarely shop there myself.<br /><br />The ten rules laid down by Sam are a mix of your commonsensical, homespun aphorisms to amazing insights that take on new meaning in today's environment. Relevant to today's earlier posting about corporate blogs, Sam suggests Rule #7:<br /><blockquote>Listen to everyone in your company. And figure out ways to get them talking. The folks on the front lines&#x2014;the ones who actually talk to the customer&#x2014;are the only ones who really know what's going on out there. You'd better find out what they know.</blockquote><br />There's also a healthy mix of customer service and <acronym title="Taking Care of Business">TCB</acronym> suggestions. This just bumped his book up in the <a href="/lists/currentreading.cfm">queue</a>.<br /><br /><br />

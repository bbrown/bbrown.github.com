<br />I'm in currently in the depths of installer hell. On my second attempt to get <a href="http://www.directv.com/">DirecTV</a> installed so that I can have <a href="http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/imagine/TIVO.jsp">TiVO</a>&#x2014;ahhghhahhgggh, TiVO&#x2014;and end the <a href="http://www.dishnetwork.com/">Dish Network nightmare</a>, the guy shows up way later than expected. Last time, he showed up way earlier than expected.<br /><br />I've now got to go to work for an important meeting and next week is the business trip. When will I ever get that TiVO-satisfaction I crave?<br /><br /><br />

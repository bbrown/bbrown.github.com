<br />I'm watching "Weird" Al Yankovic on VH1. That's right, <a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/weird_al_presents_al_tv/series.jhtml">Al-TV</a>&#x2014;Al's spoof MTV-like network compressed into hour-long shows&#x2014;is back. I hadn't seen it for a couple of years. Al is a wordsmith and comedian of first rank. He was just "interviewing" Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake by splicing together cuts from different interviews, but he was doing it quite masterfully. I've seen the idea done before, but his execution was perfect and clever.<br /><br />I had forgotten that he was still doing this sort of show and I guess it's time to sic TiVo on it.<br /><br /><br />

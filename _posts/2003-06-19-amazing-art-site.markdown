<br />The <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/">Art Renewal Center</a> is an amazing Web treasure! I cannot believe how many high-quality renderings of great art works they have (23,376 images) and the breadth of their catalog is stunning (2,602 artists). All of my favorite artists are here&#x2014;and probably a good many that aren't my favorites but should be.<br /><br />The site's <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/asp/database/art.asp?aid=8">Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema</a> gallery comprises 105 pictures. There's many I've never seen and I've only cruised through three of the eleven pages. My favorite, so far, has to be <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/images/artists/Alma-Tadema_Lawrence/The_Discourse.jpg"><cite>The Discourse</cite></a>. They've even got an excellent and extensive <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/articles/2001/Alma-Tadema/tadema1.asp">biography</a> of the man.<br /><br />Other favorite artists of mine include <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/asp/database/art.asp?aid=314">Maxfield Parrish</a>, <a href="/values/people/maxfieldparrish.cfm">my personal favorite</a>. His gallery, with only 72 high-quality images, lacks a biography and gets the qualitative order of his pictures completely wrong. The <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/asp/database/museum_template.asp?artist=7">William Bouguereau gallery</a> shows a remarkable amount of <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/museum/b/Bouguereau_William/bio1.asp">polish</a> and boasts 188 images of his artwork. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/asp/database/art.asp?aid=704">Thomas Cole</a> only has 17 images up but with a fairly decent biographical sketch. <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/asp/database/art.asp?aid=607">Johannes Vermeer</a> has 24 images, of which the famous <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/images/artists/v/Vermeer_Johannes/large/Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring.jpg"><cite>Girl with a Pearl Earring</cite></a> is my favorite. Lastly, <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/asp/database/art.asp?aid=2104">Joseph Wright</a> weighs in with 11 images and <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/asp/database/art.asp?aid=1137">Joseph Mallord William Turner</a>'s gallery boasts all of two pictures&#x2014;neither of which does the master justice.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.artrenewal.com/articles/2003/Living_Masters/masters1.asp">Living Masters section</a> showcases living Realist artists. I especially liked the <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/asp/database/art.asp?aid=2167">Steve Hanks</a> gallery, an artist that <a href="http://www.larrysalzman.com/">Larry</a> thankfully made me aware of. (At this point, I should tell you that there's another great source for living masters: the <a href="http://www.cordair.com/">Quent Cordair Gallery</a>. I've been visiting his site since it was created and longing for the day when I could afford some of my very own masterpieces. If you can afford them, I'd suggest you take a gander their way.)<br /><br />I haven't fully read it yet, but it's refreshing that the Center has a <a href="http://www.artrenewal.org/articles/Philosophy/philosophy1.asp">philosophy</a> behind it that is well-thought out enough to encompass six "pages" and is subtitled "The Great 20th Century Art Scam: or How Arrogance, Greed, and Folly Nearly Destroyed 2500 Years of Western Art." Sounds like a great start, there!<br /><br />If you know of any great sites like this one that offer up non-"abstract" art, please leave a comment. I'd love to expand my horizons!<br /><br /><br />

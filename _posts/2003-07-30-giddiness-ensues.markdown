<br />My review entitled "A Tale of Two Java Books" was accepted by Slashdot for publication. Okay, so it's not the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/"><cite>New York Times Review of Books</cite></a>&#x2014;and I generally think that's a good thing&#x2014;but it's something. The review, which hasn't been posted yet, compares and contrasts two introductory Java texts I've read recently: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590591461/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Beginning Java Objects</cite></a> (Web site: <a href="http://www.objectstart.com/">ObjectStart</a>) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596004656/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Head First Java</cite></a> (Web site: <a href="http://www.headfirstjava.com/">Head First Java</a>).<br /><br />I'll put the book review in the <a href="/writings/reviews.cfm">reviews section</a> once I get a chance. I didn't want to pre-empt <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> and I may just incorporate the inevitable criticisms that will occur in the discussion.<br /><br />The one thing that I can say off the bat about my review is that it's a little more negative towards <cite>Head First Java</cite> than I really think. There's nothing explicit, but there's an subtle slighting of <cite>HFJ</cite> in it. I think that it's an excellent book and might be sufficient for many people, but <cite>Beginning Java Objects</cite> is more systematic and that's my personal learning style. While I enjoyed <cite>HFJ</cite> immensely, I couldn't have read it first or solely.<br /><br />Once it gets posted to the public site, I'll link up to it here.<br /><br />[UPDATE (7/31/03): Looks like they're taking their sweet time in publishing my vaunted review. Since my credibility may be called into question, here's a snippet of a screenshot showing Slashdot's acceptance:]<br /><div align="center"><img src="/images/blog/slashdotsubmission.gif" width="400" height="181" alt="Slashdot accepted my review" /></div><br /><br />[UPDATE (8/6/03): Okay, they've <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/30/1751243&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=108&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=156">published</a> my review. Predictably, page views are <strong>through the roof</strong>: approximately 2,200 as of 6:20 p.m. compared to an average of about 300-450!]<br /><br /><br />

I just completed defensive driving class last Saturday and it's time for my biennial reformation. I'm hoping I can make it stick this time because tickets are such a waste of time. They're like a tax on the impatient. And <a href="http://bbrown.info/2005/01/24/taxing-developments-2.aspx">I hate taxes</a>.
</p>
<p>
But first, I suppose I should confess to my sins in this regard. My speeding has gotten worse since my <a href="http://bbrown.info/2003/08/15/interesting-thought-2.aspx">earlier mention</a>, and I've added an element of daredevilishness to it as well. At the time of that earlier entry, I was driving a 1999 Toyota Camry but I was driving it like I drove my Ford Mustang. Now that I have <a href="http://bbrown.info/2006/06/07/buzz-buzz.aspx">my MINI Cooper</a> I finally have the combination of speed and maneuverability that fully released my inner speed demons.
</p>
<p>
I speed excessively: I've gone over 100 MPH so many times that it's stopped being special and I've gotten my car up to 121 MPH on I-17 at night. I change lanes aggressively in an effort to pass and I do so on all sides, across multiple lanes, and usually abruptly. I egg road ragers on. I speed on residential streets, I speed through school zones (but only when those signs are still up at 5 PM in defiance of the law). I've done moves that left me cackling uncontrollably afterwards with amazement that I made it through without a scratch.
</p>
<p>
I still don't think that speeding is inherently evil or that I was putting anyone's life in danger. I maintain tight control of my vehicle and always focus on driving as my primary activity when I'm in the car. I like to think of myself as a good driver who likes to get from Point A to Point B in as little time as possible. I also love the act of driving (especially with the MINI Cooper): a great car becomes an extension of your will and the grace of well-executed driving is beautiful.
</p>
<p>
Now I won't go more than 30 MPH in a residential area. On the freeway, I limit myself to 10 MPH over the posted speed limit. I make infrequent lane changes and I strive to drive defensively. I've stopped worrying about the time it takes to get places and just think to myself that I'll get there when I get there.
</p>
<p>
What brought about this sea change? Was it seeing all the fatal accidents in those insipid traffic school videos? Am I just trying not to get another ticket? Am I just a-scared of my wife, who disapproves of my need for speed?
</p>
<p>
I <em>am</em> sick of giving money to municipalities unduly, but I can afford the tickets and the higher insurance premiums. I <em>certainly</em> don't want to get in any accidents, but I had never really got into an accident prior to the ticket. My wife <em>definitely</em> complains about the risks I take, but I've been married 13 years and she's realized that that set of complaints has fallen on deaf ears.
</p>
<p>
In the end, I just don't see my life being better for being a speeder. As careful a driver as I am, I am one drunk driver away from being in a situation where my competence is irrelevant. I'm good at anticipating other drivers' actions but I'm not omniscient. I could not imagine leaving my family without me; I can't imagine ending that relationship prematurely.
</p>
<p>
Further, speeding is stressful. You're constantly looking out for policeman, calculating how to get around a wolf pack, and speeding up only to slow down. Constant speeds are so relaxing. And I've found that I might only save a few minutes by driving like I did. I've got enough things in my life to stress over, but driving isn't one of them. I'd much rather fret and expend mental effort on something important.
</p>
<p>
Given that rationale for my behavioral change, I think it's going to be a long time before I get my next ticket. This move just feels right and driving has become <em>more</em> pleasurable, not less, because I can focus exclusively on my handling. And when I do need to speed, it will be like when I use a curse word: exhilirating from its rarity.

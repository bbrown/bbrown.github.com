<p>I've created a new category called <a href="/categories/Soda%20Reviews.aspx">"Soda Reviews"</a> that will chronicle my explorations through the aisles and shelves of <a href="http://www.popsoda.com/">Pop the Soda Shop</a>. Pop the Soda Shop is a local business that sells hundreds of varieties of soda. I've been going to it for years but every time I visit as a soda amnesiac&#x2014;I simply can't remember what I liked or didn't and it inevitably ends up with me experiencing d&#xE9;j&#xE0;-bu.</p>
<p>This new category and commitment of my memories to <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/blog/landing.asp">Quick Blog</a>'s database should help eliminate purchases of repeat offenders and insure repeat purchases of favorites. A warning: I am not a food writer and I can't promise to bring anything to the table beyond my thoughts at first blush. My tastes are likely different than yours and I'm doing this mostly for myself.</p>

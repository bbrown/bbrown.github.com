<br />I had a vasectomy today and, as a public service, I've <a href="http://www.fivebrowns.com/2005/12/the-end-of-the-line/">written it up</a> over at <a href="http://www.fivebrowns.com/">my other blog</a>. Executive overview: shot hurt like hell, rest was no big deal, recovery's been primo.<br /><br />[UPDATE (12/2/2005): To John's girlfriend, it was actually "Hellacious pain, living nightmare and I'll never play the piano again."]<br /><br /><br />

<br />If you're looking for a great earbud replacement for your stock iPod earphones, look no further than the <a href="/writings/html/etymoticer6.cfm">Etymotic ER-6</a>. I use my pair every day; it's great for <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,62396,00.html">tuning out the world</a>. What's more, Amazon has them for $99, which is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001DW0YA/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/">$25 less</a> than what I paid for mine off eBay. They list as out of stock for some reason, but you can still try to order them.<br /><br /><br />

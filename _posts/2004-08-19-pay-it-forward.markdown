<br />Tonight I was effectively part of the road team for an obscure Seattle hip-hop group. I was in the drive-through at McDonald's pumping out some <a href="http://www.optimusrhyme.com/">Optimus Rhyme</a> when I pulled up to the payment window. The guy at the window asked what I was playing and I told him the name of the band. He looked puzzled and kind of shrugged.<br /><br />I asked if he liked hip-hop and he affirmed that he did. So I gave him the CD-R of the music downloaded off the site. He looked even more puzzled than before&#x2014;obviously this was the first CD given to him through the drive-through window. I further told him that he should go to their Web site if he liked what he heard.<br /><br />And so another human is exposed to Autobeat music.<br /><br /><br />

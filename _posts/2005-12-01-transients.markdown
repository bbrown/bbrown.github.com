<br />I just found out that the idiot <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/hostile-work-environments.cfm">who made my life a living hell</a> at <a href="http://www.desertschools.org/">my last job</a> is leaving. Apparently, he had been interviewing and trying to get another job for the last two months. It's funny to me because he was supposed to be in it for the long haul but his loyalty lasted all of four months before he got the itch to leave. We spent longer trying to find someone for the position he eventually took than he spent in it.<br /><br />He was certainly a better investment from the credit union's perspective than I was. :-)<br /><br /><br />

<br />The Bush administration <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=812823">will nominate</a> <a href="http://cox.house.gov/">Representative Christopher Cox</a> to be the next chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission. Since he's a sitting Congressman, I don't expect that his colleagues in the Senate will contest his nomination.<br /><br />While he's done some excellent work in the House, he was a single voice in a chamber of 435. As head of the SEC, he will be the man and his views will have an effect. I am hoping that such power doesn't corrupt him; the last thing we need is another Alan Greenspan.<br /><br />Cox is a <a href="http://cox.house.gov/html/coverage.cfm?id=548">fan</a> of Ayn Rand's, going so far as to write a <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/internet/1995.08.10.html">review</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452274044/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>The Letters of Ayn Rand</cite></a> for <cite>The New York Times</cite>. His intimacy with Objectivism definitely isn't on par with Greenspan's, but as far as I know he's consistently come on the right side of political issues.<br /><br />Here's hoping that a Chairman Cox actually pushes through some real regulatory reforms at the SEC, which badly needs it.<br /><br /><br />

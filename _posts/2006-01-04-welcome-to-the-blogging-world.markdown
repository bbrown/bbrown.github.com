Guy Kawasaki now has <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">a blog</a>. I've read all of his books, starting with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0673461750/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>The Macintosh Way</cite></a>, and I have tremendous respect for him. Sadly, he's now brought my feed count up to 279. *sigh*

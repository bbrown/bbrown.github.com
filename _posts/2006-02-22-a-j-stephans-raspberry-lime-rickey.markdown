<p>Iâ€™ve wanted to try one ever since Mr. Burns scolded someone for <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/4F05.html">interrupting his lime rickey</a>. Carbonated, but not overly so. Can hardly taste the lime. Zero aftertaste. Solid drink, nothing spectacular.<br /><br /><strong>3 of 5 stars</strong></p>

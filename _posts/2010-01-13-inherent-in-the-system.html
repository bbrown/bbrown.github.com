<h2>The Federal Reserve and the Great Depression</h2>
<h3 style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</h3>
<p>
With few exceptions, every theory expounded regarding the cause of the 
Great Depression is wrong. More exactly, they all lack
fundamentality&mdash;they can be explained by deeper causes. Nearly all
place the blame squarely on the shoulders of the private
sector&mdash;whether the stock market, monopolists, or the commercial
banks. A deeper examination of the facts and a skeptical attitude towards
the conventional wisdom are all that are necessary to expose the true
protagonist: <em>the government</em>.
</p>
<p>
Conventional wisdom holds that government is what got America out of the
Great Depression. Furthermore, a lack of governmental activism during the
preceding decade is frequently cited as a contributing factor. Promiscuous
speculation in the stock market and real estate are viewed as results of
federal passivity during the Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover
Administrations. Overproduction is seen as the fault of greedy
businessmen, seeking to foist their products on an avaricious public. The
collapse of the banking system is attributed to laxity of government
oversight.
</p>
<p>
As with most of conventional wisdom, there is an element of truth to each
of these assertions. Indeed, there was rampant stock and real estate
speculation, but it did not arise from federal inaction. Overproduction
did stagnate American companies, but it was not caused by businessmen or a
spendthrift public. Finally, the banks did collapse&mdash;and this is very
significant&mdash;but it was not because of regulatory incompetence. Each
of these three very important was the result of precisely the thing most
people would say was missing: government intervention.
</p>
<p>
The federal government has had a long and varied history of meddling with
the money supply. Previous interference pales in comparison to the
paradigm shift that occurred in 1913 with the passage of the Federal
Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve System, in a single sweep, changed both
the scope and the magnitude of government intervention in the banking and
monetary systems. It had the power to regulate the size and growth of the
money supply, thereby causing inflation or deflation in the economy. It is
my contention that, through manipulation of credit, the Federal Reserve
system empowered a credit expansion the likes of which were previously
thought impossible. When the steadily expanding credit bubble finally
burst&mdash;with the crash of the overinflated stock market it had
created&mdash;the consequent credit contraction was more severe than any
before.
</p>
<p>
Why should we study the Great Depression? Of what use is history? History
is the study of the human past with an eye towards an application of its
lessons to the our future. Ideas are the prime movers of history. As the
philosopher Ayn Rand said, "If you know a man's convictions, you can
predict his actions. If you understand the dominant philosophy of a
society, you can predict its course."<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a>
If we can understand the ideas and philosophy behind the Great Depression,
we can seek to eradicate those ideas from our midst in order to stave off
a repetition of their enaction. By examining the facts surrounding the
monetary interventionism, we can see the logical consequences of the
underlying ideas. We can then compare the past situation to our present
and apply the lessons learnt from a study of the past to the reality of
today. History is not a trivial, ivory tower study of past minuti&aelig;.
It is a useful endeavor essential to a long-range consciousness&mdash;a
conceptual being.
</p>
<p>
Before we can examine the philosophical underpinnings of monetary
interventionism, it is crucial to understand the concept of money. Money
came about when men realized the limitations of barter&mdash;<em>viz.</em>,
that you had to find someone who had what you wanted and wanted what you
had. This double coincidence of wants does not happen often. Therefore,
people found something that everyone wanted that could be used in general
exchanges. What this thing was varied, from stones to shells. Eventually,
though, most civilizations latched onto gold as money since it is durable,
divisible, and rare. This use of gold as money was not imposed on men by
authorities; it was freely chosen.
</p>
<p>
It was accepted because every man recognized what it represented:
productive work. When you accept payment via money for your services or
product sold, you are implicitly operating under the assumption that you
can then use that money received to purchase the fruits of someone else's
labor. You are trusting in the integrity of that money and that is the
basis of the sound money school of economics.
</p>
<blockquote>
The abandonment of the gold standard made it possible for the welfare
statists <em>to use the banking system</em> as a means to an unlimited
expansion of credit. They have created paper reserves in the form of
government bonds which&mdash;through a complex series of steps&mdash;the
banks accept in place of tangible assets and treat as if they were an
actual deposit, <em>i.e.</em>, as the equivalent of what was formerly a
deposit of gold. The holder of a government bond or of a bank deposit
created by paper reserves believes that he has a valid claim on a real
asset. But the fact is that there are now more claims outstanding than
real assets.<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
What most of today's economists forget or overlook is that credit is
<em>not</em> money. Where money allowed individuals to split a transaction
physically&mdash;thus avoiding the double coincidence of
wants&mdash;credit allows them to split a transaction temporally. "Credit
is the promise to pay one trader accepts in lieu of immediate payment."<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a>
There are many differences between credit and money. Most notably, it can
be created at will between two traders. One trader gives another the
fruits of his labor in exchange for a promise of repayment plus some
amount to compensate for the risk the credit-granter is undertaking. It is
non-transferable, being an obligation between two parties solely. Credit
expansion does not devalue existing credit, as inflation does to the money
supply. To sum, credit is simply a promise to repay the lender out of the
future earnings of the debtor over a specific period of time.
</p>
<p>
When government debases the currency, either by running the presses or
through seigniorage, it is subverting the very cornerstone of economic
transactions. As Keynes said, "There is no subtler, no surer means of
overturning the existing basis of society that to debauch the currency."<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a>
Capitalism is the social system which recognizes the individual's rights
to life, liberty, and property. It is a system the hallmark of which is
the right of traders to freely negotiate to their mutual benefit&mdash;the
trader principle. Its antipode&mdash;statism&mdash;holds that the state is
supreme and that what rights you possess are granted by the state. The
state can intervene however, whenever, and on whomever it pleases in
whatever manner it finds expedient.
</p>
<p>
This political philosophy can be seen as the dominant trend of the
twentieth century&mdash;properly called the Age of Statism. For our
purposes, we will examine the intervention in one specific area: the money
supply. By intervention, we are really talking about an abrogation of the
property rights of individuals "specifically of those individuals who own
banks and indirectly of those individuals who do business with banks."<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a>
</p>
<p>
First, I will enumerate the means by which such interventions are
effected. Second, I will show the results of such meddling in various
sectors&mdash;banking, commerce, investments&mdash;during the Great
Depression. Third, I will summarize alternative explanations for the Great
Depression and their respective analytical failings. Finally, I will
present the lessons to be learned for today.
</p>
<h3 style="font-weight:bold;">Interventions of the Fed&mdash;Theory</h3>
<p>
The Federal Reserve System&mdash;enacted by Congress in 1913&mdash;was an
attempt to smooth out the little-understood business cycles that plagued
the American economy and were especially troubling to the banking system.
It was charged with ensuring the appropriate reserves of its member banks,
lending to shaky financial institutions to prevent closure, issuing
government securities, and regulating the overall banking industry.
Throughout the seventy-four year history of the System, the American
currency and monetary system has undergone many changes, going from a
relatively pure gold standard at its inception to an adulterated standard
in the forties and finally eliminating any gilded ties in the seventies.
</p>
<p>
The Fed&mdash;as it is colloquially called&mdash;has assumed many more
responsibilities than the drafters of the original legislation envisioned.
Even so, its operations have changed very little over time. The most
important, for our purposes, of its roles are: setter of reserve
requirements, lender of last resort, and regulator of the money supply. It
is through these three functions that the government manipulates the
economy most fundamentally. Let's examine each function in greater detail.
</p>
<p>
Individuals lend banks money in the form of deposits. The banks issue the
depositors something conveying a promise to pay on demand. Since the bank
now owns this money, it can lend the money to others to earn some
interest. In case the depositor wants his money back, the bank needs to
hold some money back from its lending activities. These deposits held back
are called reserves. The higher its reserves, the less it has to fear when
there is a fluctuation in the daily needs. However, if the reserves are
kept too high, the loan portfolio is not productive and profitable enough.
Therefore, a balance must be struck.
</p>
<p>
Prior to the Federal Reserve, each bank had to be responsible for
maintenance of its reserves&mdash;although there was an established legal
floor. If the bank misjudged its needs, it either had to call its loans or
cease transacting business. Poor judgment led to what is known as a
run&mdash;which occurs when depositors lose confidence in the bank's
ability to meet its obligations and seek to withdraw their money. If this
happens with any prevalence, this can shake the stability of the banking
system.
</p>
<p>
The central bank theorists presume that the bankers&mdash;if left to their
own judgment&mdash;will stay fully loaned up to the legal reserve
requirement floor, rather than maintaining a equalizing balance between
loans and reserves. For this reason, the Federal Reserve System was
granted the authority to centrally alter the reserve requirements of every
bank. Far more important than this ability is its power to determine what
constitutes reserves. Previously, individual banks kept reserves in their
vaults and the reserves were simply gold or silver specie, depending on
the era. With the advent of the Federal Reserve System, banks were
compelled to maintain their reserves at the regional Federal Reserve Bank.
</p>
<p>
In so doing, the Fed also altered the nature of such reserves. As stated
prior, reserves had taken the form of deposits withheld from lending
operations. Shortly after its inception, the Fed allowed reserves to be
kept in Federal Reserve notes (ostensibly representing a corresponding
amount of gold) and government securities at a ratio fixed by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve. This alteration accomplished two
objectives: banks could purchase various vehicles for use as reserves and
still be able to lend their deposits and the government had a ready buyer
for any new issues of securities.
</p>
<p>
One cannot understate the importance of this fundamental change in the
American system. Government expenditures could soar high above revenues
and the Federal Reserve would aggressively market the deficit spending to
an avaricious banking system eager to expand its ability to extend credit.
Or, put another way, the government could create fiat money out of thin
air&mdash;effectively, an edict by expenditure. Previously, the only means
by which government expenditures could increase were by the
politically-inexpedient tax hike. Now, it had the Federal Reserve as its
overdraft protection and the Fed could draw from the productivity and
wealth of the entire American banking system.
</p>
<p>
By manipulating the reserves of the banks, however, the Federal Reserve
also contributed to the banking system's unsoundness. The last thing a
bank needs is an aura of insolvency, yet that is precisely what the
Federal Reserve System engenders. The Fed issues its Notes at an arbitrary
ratio to its gold holdings; the banks then use these Federal Reserve Notes
as reserves in another arbitrary ratio to its deposit base. Or, the banks
use government securities&mdash;created out of thin air&mdash;as reserves
and lend against them at a large multiple. The problem in this activity is
that the underlying value of the reserves has gone from significant (in
the case of actual money stored in a bank's vault) to insignificant (in
the case of gold-based Notes) to none (in the case of fiat government
securities). In the banking industry, this is called lower quality of
liquidity.
</p>
<p>
Not only that, but the Fed also sets the reserve requirements in a vacuum
of information. Bankers, by virtue of their daily contact and intimate
knowledge of the local business community, are better able to assess the
bank's balance sheet and respond accordingly.<a href="#6" class="footnote">6</a>
That is the way it attracts depositors and customers, by a reputation for
fiscal soundness. When a bank is free to fail, the bank has an interest in
maintaining liquidity. Its management must balance the assets and
liabilities carefully and prudently. But the Fed acts in the aggregate in
setting reserve requirements, thereby punishing the most able bankers (by
setting their reserve requirement above what they would have) and
rewarding the incompetent (by allowing them to keep lower reserves than
necessary).
</p>
<p>
The Fed, in its original legislation, was charged with operating as "the
lender of last resort." This meant that, if a bank found itself in an
illiquid position, it could borrow from the Fed to see it through the
situation. Initially, the bank had to pledge some valuable
asset&mdash;such as commercial paper&mdash;as collateral to the Fed, but
that requirement was soon dropped and now anything is eligible. Under this
guise, the Federal Reserve sought to prevent the bank runs and systemic
bank failures of past times. In effect, the Fed would prop up the banking
system using its monopoly on money creation.
</p>
<p>
This, again, ties in with the above discussion on reserve requirements,
since the lender of last resort function kicks in when the bank is in a
jam. Each of these seeks to correct a "failure" of the nineteenth
century's free-banking system. The former to forestall bank insolvency and
the latter to avert bank panics. As with reserve requirements, there are
considerable unforeseen consequences to the lender of last resort
function. The first&mdash;and most obvious&mdash;problem is that it makes
no distinction between illiquid banks and insolvent banks. The former are
in a bind; the latter are in dire straits. The Federal Reserve
<em>qua</em> lender of last resort would come to the rescue of each
equally.<a href="#7" class="footnote">7</a>  The effect, then, is to
further destabilize an already problematic situation.
</p>
<p>
Another problem is that this policy favors the risk-takers. Traditionally,
bankers are viewed as a rather conservative lot. They invest depositor's
funds in stable, safe instruments. This is true of most financial
institutions; there are some, however, in search of higher yields and
quicker returns that&mdash;armed with the knowledge that the Fed would
bail them out&mdash;invest in riskier ventures. The Federal Reserve, as I
said, does not differentiate between the temporarily illiquid and the
fundamentally bankrupt.
</p>
<p>
The final function of the Federal Reserve that we will consider is its
unique position as regulator of the money supply. A cursory examination of
financial news coverage yields many pundits prognosticating the
pronouncements of Greenspan. Measured answers to Congressional committees
by the Fed Chairman can bring the bond market to its knees. The Fed
determines interest rates; the Fed expands or contracts credit; the Fed
inflates or deflates the money supply. All of these actions have
inestimable consequences in the economy.
</p>
<p>
It is important to remember that credit is not necessarily a bad thing. It
is simply a splitting of a transaction across time. It does not result in
inflation, <em>i.e.</em>, an increase in the money supply. If it is caused
by production, it is perfectly legitimate and may be expanded indefinitely
without any ill effects on the economy. Where credit runs into trouble is
when it is caused by artificial and arbitrary reserve manipulations. As
mentioned previously, when the reserve quality is diluted or the reserve
ratios inappropriately lowered, money is conjured up and lent
irresponsibly. For now, when I speak of credit expansions, I am dealing
with the interventionist variety.
</p>
<p>
The Federal Reserve can affect credit levels of the banking industry
through two means: the rediscount and open-market operations. During the
period in consideration&mdash;1913 to 1933&mdash;the rediscount was the
primary means of expanding the availability of credit. In that time,
commercial loans were generally short-term. The bank would take its
interest off the top of the loan, before it was ever given to the
customer. This was called the discount. The customer was then responsible
for paying the full value of the loan, <em>i.e.</em>, what he borrowed
plus the interest. While this loan was on the books of the bank, it tied
up deposits that must be reserved. If the bank were hard-pressed to meet
its transactional obligations, the Fed could purchase the loan at another
discount, or <em>rediscount</em>, and relieve the reserve pressure. If the
bank was seeking more loans, it had to wait for the loan to come due and
then relend it. Or, it could use the rediscounting ability of the Fed to
free up its reserves for another loan. "A rate below the market rate
encourages borrowing, not merely for reserve compensation, but for
acquiring excess reserves to relend at a profit."<a href="#8" class="footnote">8</a>
If the discount rate of the Fed is less than the prime rate at which the
bank lends to its best customers, it can make further profit off the
spread between the two rates and repay the Fed with the money from the new
loan.<a href="#9" class="footnote">9</a>
</p>
<p>
This is an efficient way of expanding credit but, due to the short-term
nature of the original loan, the rediscounting does not have much effect
unless such pyramiding of loans is more or less constantly applied. If the
discount rate is non-punitive, then it becomes profitable for the bank to
sell all its loans to the Fed. However, "[t]he tradition had grown that a
bank should not borrow for the purpose of relending at a profit. The
tradition was strong that great city banks did not like to be in debt at
all to the Federal Reserve banks&hellip;."<a href="#10" class="footnote">10</a>
Later we will revisit rediscounting as these traditions broke down.
</p>
<p>
By far the most prevalent means of credit manipulation is through
open-market operations.<a href="#11" class="footnote">11</a> This
circumlocution simply designates the purchase or sale of government
securities in the market, rather than through direct infusions from the
Treasury. Since government securities fulfill the reserve requirements of
the Fed, their accumulation enables credit expansion. Moreover, these
operations establish a ready market for the rapid distribution of
government debt. In its capacity as buyer and seller of the securities,
the Federal Reserve obtains liquidity and stability for the government.
Previous bond issues had to be publicly promoted and took awhile to be
sold. The secondary trade was haphazard and done through commissioned
agents.
</p>
<p>
With government spending becoming increasingly profligate, the power of
the Federal Reserve System to absorb the deficit through purchases of
government securities becomes increasingly more important. As show prior,
though, such financing comes with a price far greater than the interest
charged. The excess reserves thus generated are converted into available
credit, which is lent to economic agents. As Dr. Anderson says,
</p>
<blockquote>
When there is an excess of bank credit used as a substitute for savings,
when bank credit goes in undue amounts into capital uses and speculative
uses, impairing the liquidity of bank assets, or when the total volume of
money and credit is expanded far beyond the growth of production and
trade, disequilibria arise, and, above all, the <em>quality</em> of credit
is impaired. Confidence may be suddenly shaken and a countermovement may
set in.<a href="#12" class="footnote">12</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Cheap money&mdash;an effect of the open market operations&mdash;sends
erroneous signals to whomever uses it. When interest rates are
artificially low, which occurs with credit flooding, individuals believe
that it is a sign of good times and a promising outlook on the future.
Interest rates are a measure of risk and low ones signal good fortune.
Therefore, investments are made based on this information. A "boom"
ensues. This is followed, depending on the amount of credit expansion, by
a burst, as the needle of disequilibrium pops the bubble of false
expectations. In our examination of the period leading up to the Great
Depression, we will see how this process unfolded and ultimately resulted
in all the problems associated with that time.
</p>
<h3 style="font-weight:bold;">Interventions of the Fed&mdash;Practice</h3>
<p>
Given the pervasiveness of the Fed's activity and the purview of the
banking system in the American economy, the effects of the aforementioned
practices is incredible. Three particular sectors stand out for further
scrutiny: banking, commerce, and finance. These correspond to the most
visible and memorable afflictions of the Great Depression: bank closures,
unemployment, and the stock market crash, respectively. Each of these
three effects of inflationary credit expansion have been alleged to have
caused the Great Depression. As I shall make clear, they contributed to
the severity of the Depression, but were not fundamental enough to be
causal.
</p>
<p>
The enactment of the Federal Reserve brought almost immediate changes to
the American banking system. Prior to the Federal Reserve Act, banks kept
their own reserves in their own vaults. The reserve ratio hovered around
21.1 percent.<a href="#13" class="footnote">13</a> By 1917, the Act had
legislated the reserve requirement to a mere 10 percent.<a href="#14" class="footnote">14</a>
Furthermore, the gold standard was devalued, since the Federal Reserve was
only required to keep gold reserves of 40 percent against the Federal
Reserve Notes and 35 percent against its members' deposits.<a href="#15" class="footnote">15</a>
This all occurred within five years of the System's inception. The
expansion amounted to $5.8 billion in deposits and $7 billion in loans and
investments.<a href="#16" class="footnote">16</a> This accommodated the
financing of World War I in lieu of increased taxation and, at least, had
some justification. What happened next is best summarized by Dr. Anderson:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
	We watched bank credit with fear and trembling as it expanded during World
	War I, because we knew then what we seem since to have forgotten, the
	dangers of overexpanded bank credit. We held it down all we could. But a
	great expansion was needed and we made it. It was enough. An expansion of
	$5.8 billion in deposits, with $7 billion in loans and investments, was
	enough.
</p>
<p>
	Between the middle of 1922 and April 1928, without need, without
	justification, lightheartedly, irresponsibly, we expanded bank credit by
	more than twice as much, and in the years which followed we paid a
	terrible price for this.<a href="#17" class="footnote">17</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The episode he spoke of&mdash;the 1922-28 credit expansion&mdash;began in
1922 with the first large open-market purchase of government securities,
increasing the holdings of government securities by the Federal Reserve
from $250 million to approximately $650 million&mdash;an increase of 260
percent!<a href="#18" class="footnote">18</a> This first large-scale
operation was instigated, not for credit expansion or interest rate
suppression, because rediscounting had slackened after the war and Federal
Reserve reserves were faltering. The heady, unintended credit expansion
was too profitable to make it a one-time deal. Consequently, two more
major open-market purchases of government securities occurred in 1924 and
1927, each amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;a scale
unprecedented in the history of the United States. Plus, due to the
multiplying effect of securities <em>qua</em> reserves, billions of
dollars  became available for lending&mdash;again, out of thin air. These
purchases were motivated solely by credit expansion, without any thought
to the "dangers of overexpanded bank credit."
</p>
<p>
By these open-market operations and reserve fiddling, bank credit had
expanded $11.5 billion in only five years.<a href="#19" class="footnote">19</a>
If it had reflected a genuine need by businesses, it would have been
welcome and salutary. Since commerce had no use for the available credit,
banks sought other venues in which to channel the funds. The three primary
vehicles were mortgages, financial instruments, and foreign loans. Each of
these represented a deviation from traditional banking practices,
<em>viz.</em>, the financing of short-term commercial requests.
Short-term, because it helped to maintain the liquid position of the bank;
commercial, because these tended to be the borrowers best able to repay.
Mortgages and financial instruments&mdash;like bonds and
securities&mdash;are particularly susceptible to fluctuations in value.
Loans made to foreign governments&mdash;predominantly Latin American
ones&mdash; were risky, since revolution and instability were the norm.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, each of these types of loans is ineligible for rediscounting.
Since rediscounting was the primary secondary reserve of the whole System,
this meant that a significant portion of the bank's assets were
constrained. As of June 30, 1926, the Federal Reserve released the
following statement, "Of the total loans and investments of all member
banks on June 30, 1926, sixteen percent was eligible for rediscount at the
reserve banks&hellip;."<a href="#20" class="footnote">20</a> With
increased long-term holdings and decreased potential for rediscounting,
the banks were in a pretty precarious position by the end of twenties. All
that was needed was a scaling-down of the expansion&mdash;maybe even a
contraction&mdash; thereby allowing banks to liquidate imprudent
investments gradually. This could be accomplished by setting the
rediscount rate above the market rate and strictly limiting the use of
open-market operations.<a href="#21" class="footnote">21</a>
</p>
<p>
This, however, was exactly what the Federal Reserve Board did <em>not</em>
do. In 1927, the Federal Reserve Board, under the Chairmanship of Benjamin
Strong, inaugurated a new policy of cheap money to help the farmer.<a href="#22" class="footnote">22</a>
The Fed lowered the buying rate on acceptances&mdash;essentially future
loan drafts&mdash;in the summer of 1927; sharply increased&mdash;by $320
million&mdash;its purchase of government securities through November; and
lowered its systemwide rediscount rate to 3.5 percent by September of that
year.<a href="#23" class="footnote">23</a>
</p>
<p>
This time, the credit expansion was funneled almost exclusively into
stocks. While further comment will be reserved for later, it bears mention
that this growth in stock market investment that started in 1927 continued
right up until the Crash. The Federal Reserve authorities desperately
tried to reverse their mistake, increasing the rediscount rate to five
percent by July 1928 and selling over $400 million worth of government
securities by June 1928. This divestiture reduced bank reserves,
necessitating over $600 million in rediscounting&mdash;though not enough
to fully account for the reduction in reserves.<a href="#24" class="footnote">24</a>
</p>
<p>
In the week following the stock market crash, the Fed doubled its holdings
of government securities. The Fed was trying desperately to increase its
reserve situation, but could barely keep its head above water due to the
continuous outflow of gold to other nations.<a href="#25" class="footnote">25</a>
Throughout the crisis period&mdash;1929 to 1933&mdash;the Federal Reserve
continued its inflationary policies in a futile attempt to initiate
another boom akin to that of the twenties.
</p>
<p>
By the end of 1930, however, the fundamental instability of the Federal
Reserve System became apparent. "The number of commercial banks in the
United States stood at 29,087 on June 30, 1920 &hellip; [and] at 15,353 on
June 30, 1934."<a href="#26" class="footnote">26</a> In the period 1930-33
alone, a total of 9,106 banks failed.<a href="#27" class="footnote">27</a>
Bank failures had always been endemic to the Federal Reserve System,
though, averaging 166 per year between 1913-1922 and 692 per year between
1923-1929.<a href="#28" class="footnote">28</a> The reason for this should
by now be clear.
</p>
<p>
In creating money from nothing for banks to lend, the government distorts
the market processes that regulate the economy. Credit arises from
production. It cannot be overextended by private institutions, since they
do not possess the power to counterfeit and debase."The creation of credit
by banks is a productive enterprise in which all participating parties
hope to benefit, and in which non-participating parties are not directly
affected."<a href="#29" class="footnote">29</a> Banks, in selecting where
to extend credit, must necessarily be choosy. They must maintain liquidity
at all costs, while maximizing the return on their investments.
</p>
<p>
Under the Federal Reserve, however, the banks find themselves awash in
credit, regardless of the financial needs of their customers. They feel
pressure to lend, without the assistance of a customer seeking a loan.
Thus, they seek out anyone willing to take the credit off their hands. In
the competitive world of banking, quality and creditworthiness are
luxuries they cannot afford to consider. As one banking historian put it,
"numerous examiner reports cited bank failures as due to 'generosity
to borrowers'&hellip;with insufficient attention paid to discipline, the
result of which is detrimental to both borrowers and lenders in the long
run."<a href="#30" class="footnote">30</a> The banks end up carrying a
portfolio of speculative stock and real estate loans, long-term mortgages,
and loans to impoverished countries. When the public loses confidence in
the financial establishment, the banking industry bleeds to death until
wholesale liquidation ensues.
</p>
<p>
That is, unless the government frees the banking industry from meeting its
obligations&mdash;through the banking holiday&mdash;or unless the
government sets the money supply adrift&mdash;through the abandonment of
the gold standard. Both of these things happened in 1933. These two
events, then, were the culmination and the pinnacle of intervention in the
banking system. They represent the logical outcome of manipulations of the
type previously enumerated.
</p>
<p>
Another part of the economy that is deeply affected by Federal Reserve
policies, albeit indirectly, is the private business sector. I am not
speaking of any particular industry, but commerce as a whole. When we
think of businesses in the Great Depression, we think of joblessness and
overproduction. Not unemployment or large inventories on an individual,
localized level, but on a nationwide scale. One must ask the question: how
is it that problems can occur so? How can so many individual businessmen
make erroneous judgments at the same time? This points to a more
fundamental issue, one that <em>can</em> uniformly lead to miscalculation.
</p>
<p>
Once again, we find that the source of dislocation is expansion of bank
credit divorced from any real source of expansion. In the boom, or
inflationary, period, the businessman engages in a process of predicting
the future return or value of present projects. One of the factors
entering into his calculations is the interest rate&mdash;a measure of the
cost of future goods versus present consumption. The drop in interest
rates inherent in an inflationary environment<a href="#31" class="footnote">31</a>
interferes with the businessman's planning.<a href="#32" class="footnote">32</a>
It implies an increase in the rate of thrift&mdash;traditionally the
source of available capital&mdash;by individuals and corporations. This
causes a shift by the businessman from investment in consumer goods to
investment in higher-order capital goods.<a href="#33" class="footnote">33</a>
"[A]n expansion in the production facilities and the production of the
heavy industries, and in the production of durable producers' goods, is
the most conspicuous mark of the boom."<a href="#34" class="footnote">34</a>
</p>
<p>
As the bubble fills, productive capacity is expanded. Capital goods are
acquired and implemented. Money flows into the capital goods industry.
This money, remember, is not the result of increased savings, but from
"forced" savings, <em>i.e.</em>, artificial creation of money by the
government in the form of credit expansion. But this boom is illusory.
</p>
<blockquote>
For, once workers in the higher-order industries receive income in the
form of wages and salaries, 'they would immediately attempt to expand
consumption to the usual proportions.' This sudden surge in consumption
demand undercuts the demand for the still incomplete projects involving
higher-order producer goods far removed from consumption, resulting in a
slump in the capital-goods industries.<a href="#35" class="footnote">35</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
In other words, because the savings <em>qua</em> capital is not genuine,
the money sunk into higher-order goods is spent according to existing
consumption/thrift ratios. Or: the money spent by the misinformed
entrepreneur is ultimately transferred to the consumer goods industries,
shifting demand for the capital good. That is, unless the borrowing firm
returns to the bank for more credit and temporary salvation. The greater
the credit expansion the longer it will last. When the expansion ceases,
the boom complies. "The longer the boom goes on the more wasteful the
errors committed, and the longer and more severe will be the necessary
depression readjustment."<a href="#36" class="footnote">36</a>
</p>
<p>
If we look to the historical record, we see that the facts bear this
analysis out. Productivity per person-hour increased 63 percent from 1920
to 1929.<a href="#37" class="footnote">37</a> Stock prices quadrupled
during the twenties&mdash;stock being the primary source of capital.
Durable goods, as well as steel production, increased approximately 160
percent. Non-durables, largely consumer goods, increased only 60 percent.
Moreover, wages in the capital goods industries were higher than wages in
the consumer goods industries. According to the Conference Board index,
hourly wages in manufacturing industries&mdash;such as meat packing,
hardware, and clothing&mdash;increased an average of 12 percent while
those in the capital goods industries rose even higher&mdash;12 percent in
machine tools, 19 percent in lumber, 22 percent in chemicals, and 25
percent in steel.<a href="#38" class="footnote">38</a>
</p>
<p>
The period after the boom also corroborates Mises' and Rothbard's cycle
theory. Industrial production was 114 in August 1929 and 54 in March 1933.
Business construction totaled $8.7 billion in 1929 and $1.4 billion in
1933. There also occurred a 77 percent decline in durable goods
manufacturing in the same four-year period. Unemployment rose from 3.2
percent in 1929 to 24.9 percent in 1933.<a href="#39" class="footnote">39</a>
Furthermore, from 1929 to 1932, the money supply was contracting, "and
since wages are less elastic than prices, real wages were rising
(unbeknownst to most workers), making it extremely difficult for business
to employ people."<a href="#40" class="footnote">40</a>
</p>
<p>
Our last sector of concern is the investment sector, as distinct from the
banking industry. Here I am talking about the the stock market, its
brokerage houses, and individual investors. The image that comes to mind
immediately is that of the Crash of 1929. It occurred because the general
price-to-earnings ratios&mdash;a common estimate of value in a
security&mdash;had soared far above any representation in reality. The
reason for this inordinate rise was due to speculative fever within the
general public. Everyone wanted a piece of the action and, largely, was
able to buy into it. Again, a cursory examination of the situation yields
this information and nothing more. Further probing finds the specter of
the Fed artificially propping the market.
</p>
<p>
The Fed's purchase of government securities in 1924 already mentioned was
the first instance when the additional bank credit was almost exclusively
channeled into securities&mdash;partly into direct bond purchases by banks
and partly into stock/bond collateral loans. "This immense expansion of
bank credit, added to the ordinary sources of capital, created the
illusion of unlimited capital and made it easy for our markets to absorb
gigantic quantities of foreign securities as well as a greatly increased
volume of American security issues."<a href="#41" class="footnote">41</a>
Although the 1924 issue was not the first instance of influence in the
stock market, it was most definitely not the last.
</p>
<p>
The aforementioned 1927 cheap money policy of the Fed was the final turn
that opened the floodgates of giddy speculation. By lowering the
rediscount rates, the Fed allowed the member banks to lower their own
interest rates on stock and bond collateral loans as well as brokers'
loans. When the Fed reversed its policy late in 1927, it was too late. The
psychological intoxication of the boom had taken hold of the American
public.
</p>
<p>
Eager speculators ignored increasing interest rates and took greater
volumes of brokers' loans. Even as member banks dried up the speculative
security loans, new sources were utilized, <em>viz.</em>, brokers' loans
'for account of others.'<a href="#42" class="footnote">42</a> Previously,
brokers' loans would be made for the bank's account or an out-of-town's
account, with an occasional brokers' loan for other customers. At the
beginning of 1926, such loans accounted for $564 million of a total of
$3.141 billion in brokers' loans. By the summer of 1929, these loans
totaled $3.372 billion of the total $6.085 billion in brokers' loans.<a href="#43" class="footnote">43</a>
Furthermore, call loan rates rarely exceeded 10 percent, except just prior
to the Crash, when they finally were raised to 20 percent. This also
served as a fresh source of speculation money.<a href="#44" class="footnote">44</a>
</p>
<p>
The effects of such ubiquitous investment were astounding. On November 15,
1922, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average closed at $95.11. By August 29,
1929, the Average had risen to $376.18. The Standard &amp; Poor's Common
Stocks Indices showed similar fantastic gains: the industrials, rails, and
public utilities indices had risen from 44.4, 156.0, and 66.6,
respectively, in 1921 to 172.5, 384.1, and 272.2 just six years later.<a href="#45" class="footnote">45</a>
</p>
<p>
When the bubble finally burst&mdash;in October of 1929&mdash;it shattered
confidence in the economy. The intoxication of seven years of giddy
inflationary credit expansion had resulted in an economic hangover of
heretofore unseen proportions. The following year, 1930, marked a
watershed. The government's response to the failings of the Federal
Reserve would determine the severity of the necessary liquidation and
recession. If the government allowed the market to correct itself, through
interest rate hikes and bankruptcy, the consequent recession would be
severe but brief. If, however, the government misjudged the nature of the
market, the country would be in for a slow, arduous bloodletting and,
ultimately, a future littered with cyclical depressions.
</p>
<p>
These three areas of the economy are the most important sectors and the
ones most influenced by arbitrary credit expansion by the Federal Reserve.
In each one, government monetary intervention led to dislocations,
distortions, and disequilibria. However, it would be foolish to imply
that the Federal Reserve System was the sole factor in the playing out of
the Great Depression. For the purposes of this paper, though, I will
specifically omit the sometimes drastic effects of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff
of 1930, Britain's abandonment of the gold standard, reparations from
defeated Germany, and other international elements that contributed to the
extent and severity of the Depression of 1929-1940.
</p>
<h3 style="font-weight:bold;">Alternatives</h3>
<p>
To be sure, historians and economists have not flocked to the Federal
Reserve as fundamental determinant of the Depression. Except for the few
authors whose works I have cited, the conventional wisdom holds that the
Federal Reserve had little to do with the economic downturn. Although I
think I have presented an airtight antithetical argument, I also believe
it is important to survey other's contributions to the field for the
purpose of contrariety and objectivity.
</p>
<p>
As I see it, there are two primary alternative explanations for causation
of the Great Depression. First of the alternates is the theory that the
maldistribution of income prevalent in American society prior to the
Depression created a lack of purchasing power that shook the economy to
its foundations. Second, that general overproduction resulted in systemic
dislocations. I will now examine each in turn.
</p>
<p>
The first theory, best explicated by Robert S. McElvaine, asserts that
there exists a general maldistribution of wealth in American society and
that this inequity causes the economy to be reliant on significant
spending by the well-to-do. As he puts it, "no cause of the Great
Depression was of larger importance."<a href="#46" class="footnote">46</a>
The argument goes that, because total supply must equal total demand for
the economy to be in equilibrium, a disparate burden was placed on the
wealthy&mdash;as holders of a disproportionate share of income&mdash;to
consume. But the wealthy spend only a small portion of their income in
consumer goods, preferring to invest or save their money. But since the
masses do not have the wealth necessary to purchase the residues of the
total supply left unbought, the economy is easily destabilized. "If
something caused a sudden loss of confidence by these affluent Americans,
the whole economic structure might collapse&hellip;."<a href="#47" class="footnote">47</a>
The Crash of 1929 engendered just such a loss of confidence.
</p>
<p>
The major problem with this underconsumption theory is that it posits a
zero-sum game. Any increase in the wealth of an individual must come from
the wealth of another. This is simply not the case. The economy is dynamic
and productive. The quantity of wealth is likewise not static; it can and
is created readily through production. Moreover, the money that the
wealthy accumulate is not acquired by theft, but by honest work and
production. This is the true meaning of Say's Law: production causes
consumption, for money cannot be spent without its being earned
first&mdash;except when it is counterfeited or created by issuance of
paper IOUs by the government. Thus in the long run total supply
<em>will</em> equal total demand, providing the money supply is not
tampered with, even though short-term supply and demand can fluctuate
wildly.
</p>
<p>
Another objection, and no less important than the previous one, is that
the historical record contradicts this theory. As I stated earlier, in a
boom, capital goods industries prosper relative to consumer goods. In the
subsequent depression, the situation is reversed and the capital goods
industries falter proportionally to consumer goods. The underconsumption
theory, however, posits that the consumer goods industries experience
terrific surpluses in a depression, while the capital goods industries
experience productivity increases and prosperity.<a href="#48" class="footnote">48</a>
</p>
<p>
Another significant explanation for the cause of the Great Depression is
found in the flip side of the underconsumption coin: overproduction.
Factories run full tilt during the boom period and sit idle during the
bust, along with the workers and the inventories. Gradually and
systematically, production is ceased and excess inventories are siphoned
off until equilibrium is again attained and the process repeats.
</p>
<p>
What this theory ignores is the fact that such overproduction can still be
sold. Price can be reduced to such a level that inventories would clear.
So long as there still exists some money, this scenario can be curtailed.
Even more important, the overproduction reeks of malinvestment. At some
previous point in time, the producer thought that the stagnant endeavor
would yield profits, <em>i.e.</em>, the seller thought that future prices
would cover costs of production. As we have seen, the significant cause of
such miscalculation is artificial credit expansion and its concomitant
malinvestments.<a href="#49" class="footnote">49</a>
</p>
<h3 style="font-weight:bold;">Lessons</h3>
<p>
As I stated in the Introduction, if we can understand the ideas and
underlying philosophy the Great Depression, we can seek to eradicate those
ideas from our midst and stave off a repetition of their actualization.
The fundamental idea behind the Federal Reserve System is statism. It is
the subjugation of individual freedoms and choices to the will and
interests of the state or "public good."
</p>
<p>
In the case of the Federal Reserve, we can see that the Federal Reserve
essentially dictates to the banking system what it can and cannot do.
Consequently, individual depositors experience a reduction in choice among
financial institutions, since they all are treated uniformly and it
becomes impossible to determine the reserve quality and sufficiency of an
individual bank. Furthermore, bankers are denied the possibility of
issuing banknotes against real reserves and the element of control this
encompasses. Businessmen are given mixed&mdash;and sometimes
false&mdash;signals regarding the future cost of activities, leading to
malinvestment and wasted capital. Finally, individuals are unable to
assess the underlying value of the stock market, due to the dislocations
produced by credit expansion on the part of the Fed. And volatility is
officially sanctioned through the inflationary mechanism.
</p>
<p>
The lesson, then, of the Great Depression is that statism leads to
unintended consequences and undesirable effects. It illustrates the fact
that the government has no business interfering in the private dealings of
individuals. If the government had adopted the <em>laissez-faire</em>
program it is alleged to have adopted, the economy would have contracted,
certainly, but its result would have been an economy strengthened and
sounder. By its end, banks would have found appropriate reserve ratios and
liquidated imprudent loans. Businesses would have converted misguided
endeavors into productive uses and shaken off inefficiencies. Investors
would be left with more accurately valued stockholdings and a renewed
confidence in the financial status of the nation.
</p>
<p>
This, then, is the proper policy to follow in adjusting to a depression.
It should be similarly obvious the method by which depressions may be
averted. It is time for a separation of bank and state, akin to the
separation of church and state and for the same reasons. An examination of
free banking is beyond the scope of this essay, but suffice it to say that
"[d]epositors lost more money in th[e] early phase of central banking
(1913-1933) than earlier depositors had lost in the entire 75-year free
banking period (1838-1913)."<a href="#50" class="footnote">50</a>

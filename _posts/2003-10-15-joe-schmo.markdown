<br />Last night's episode of <a href="http://www.spiketv.com/shows/joe_schmo/"><cite>Joe Schmo</cite></a> was exciting yet unfulfilling. Taking a cue from Fox, the <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/issues/2003-09-18/speakeasy.html/1/index.html">producers</a> ended the show with one vote left and announced that the season finale will air two weeks from yesterday. Ugh. They never indicated that this wasn't the last episode; in fact, the commercials leading up to the show conveyed a distinctly opposite conclusion. So I suppose that the last hour-long show will feature a little bit of announcing and 45 minutes of Matt being shocked and filling in the blanks. That should be good TV, though I wish it had happened yesterday instead of several weeks from now.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with the show, here are some <a href="http://www.joeschmo.com/joeschmo/">good summaries</a>.<br /><br /><br />

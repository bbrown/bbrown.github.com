<p>
I apologize to anyone who has visited my blog in the last five days. I was running old Movable Type and someone exploited it. I got added to Google's malware warning service, unfortunately, so you might see some warnings until the request for review is complete.

It looks like it's time to figure out how to lock down Movable Type so that this doesn't happen again&mdash;it's such a pain to upgrade that there's always going to be some lag time between security release and updating.

<br /><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> has recently launched its <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a>-killer, <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut</a>. It's very similar to Friendster except that it's invitation-only, lightweight, and not <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/teaching/6171/2003-fall/friendster">crashy</a>. There has been quite a <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/04/01/23/1738250.shtml?tid=126&amp;tid=95">furor</a> over its elitism, but I got invited.<br /><br />It looks like a really neat service. If you weren't invited and you would like to be, drop me <a href="/contact/?subject=Orkut+Invite+Please">a line</a> and I'll invite you if I know you.<br /><br /><br />

Today's new version of Kindle for iPhone/iPad adds support for page numbering. I was wondering how to cite a "location" of text from a Kindle e-book: this update shows the page numbers from the book edition alongside the "location" numbers.

I'm trying to think of what iBooks gets me over the Kindle app. Useless page-turning animations? Advanced highlighting-edge graphics? Integrated book store? Having to sync up with iTunes to safely store your notes, highlights, and positions? None of these are compelling.

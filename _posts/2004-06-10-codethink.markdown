<br />I just realized that I had been developing too long when I closed out a sentence in email with a semicolon instead of a period <em>and it took me a second to realize it didn't belong there</em>. Soon after, I realized that it was 2:30; I was expecting it to be time for lunch (11 A.M.). That's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060920432/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/">flow</a>, baby.<br /><br />NOTE: for all you non-programmers out there, in C# (and many other languages), you end every program line with a semicolon.<br /><br /><br />

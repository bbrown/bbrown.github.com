<blockquote>
Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something&mdash;your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.<p style="text-align:right;">&ndash; Steve Jobs, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA">Stanford Commencement Speech</a> (<a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">text</a>)</p>

I've never been much of a career planner. I just try to do work that interests or fascinates me for as long as I can. Once it starts to get boring or I start getting wanderlust, I look around for opportunities to seize or work on creating my own.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, though, I get a little down on the distance between where I'd like to be and where I am. That Steve Jobs quote, from a commencement address that I listen to more regularly than I ever would have thought, reminds me to not worry about it and to trust that great things are afoot.

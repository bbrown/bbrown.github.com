<br /><a href="http://actsofvolition.com/">Steven Garrity</a>, an ardent Windows user, decided to give <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> a try for a <a href="http://actsofvolition.com/archives/2003/april/awindowsuser">week</a>. Naturally, he did it on a graphite iMac (400MHz G3) running 10.2.5&#x2014;in other words, a non-ideal setup. His conclusion? He's not switching but he appreciates some of the niceties of the OS. It made me remember some of the things I take for granted on the Mac.<br /><br /><br />

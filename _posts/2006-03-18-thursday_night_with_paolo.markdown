<p>On Thursday night (3/16/2006), I went to <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Taliesin_West.html">Taliesin West</a> to listen to a free lecture by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Soleri">Paolo Soleri</a>, the <a href="http://www.desertusa.com/mag99/june/stories/ashes.html">former Wright apprentice</a> whose main claims to fame are bells he produces at his studio and the notion of an arcology. The latter has seen partial fruition in the form of Arcosanti, a sprawling, never-complete tourist attraction north of Cordes Junction, Arizona. The former seemingly supports the man and his mission.</p>

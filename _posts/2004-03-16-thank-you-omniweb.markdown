<br />I had just finished typing that last entry when my browser crashed. Ugh! That's happened many times in the past and I was dreading having to rewrite it. Luckily, I wasn't writing it in just any browser; I was writing it in <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/5/">OmniWeb 5</a>. I've sung its praises before, but this time it really saved my butt.<br /><br />Its workspace feature saves window locations, URLs, and open tabs whenever you quit, take a snapshot, or&#x2014;and this is the really applicable one right now&#x2014;crash. Little did I know, it also saves text in forms at those points too.<br /><br />So when I restarted OmniWeb after the crash, my two windows that I had minimized where in my Dock, my Blogger window came right up, and the post textarea was filled in with my blog entry.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm sure I'll be switching back to <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> anytime soon. <em>OmniWeb: It Saves Your Ass!</em><br /><br /><br />

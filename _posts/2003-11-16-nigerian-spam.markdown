<br />Now this is a first! I just received a Nigerian spam email&#x2014;you know, the one from some African who needs you to help him get $15 million out of the country&#x2014;through the <a href="/contact/">contact page</a> on this site.<br /><br />That means that some spammer visited my site and entered the scam into a form instead of getting my email address from the image. That's strange. I wonder if it's become automated or if some actual human being did that.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Apparently, the spammer was referred to me by my comment over at <a href="www.camworld.com/journal/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1230">CamWorld</a> and came from the netblock "207.50.228.xxx" which doesn't resolve. Interesting. Do I ban the IPs? As an isolated incident, I suppose that I'll let it pass.]<br /><br /><br />

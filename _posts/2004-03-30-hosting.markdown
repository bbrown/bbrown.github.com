<br />So I cancelled my <a href="http://www.zettai.net/">Zettai</a> hosting for the time being because a) I wasn't finding the time to learn Plone/Zope and b) my host reaffirmed his desire to be a host. I downloaded <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/">Blog-CFC</a> and was planning on converting from Blogger to it.<br /><br />Yesterday, my host dropped a bombshell. He was exiting the hosting business because he just didn't have the time to dedicate to it and it was costing him a lot of money with zero return. I completely understand, but now I'm in a quandary.<br /><br />Which is where you come in. I'm looking for a hosting provider with the following requirements:<ul><li>ColdFusion MX</li><li>SQL Server/MySQL</li><li>Subdomains</li><li>Multiple domain support with graduated payments&#x2014;<em>i.e.</em>, bbrown.info is $24.95/month and fourbrowns.com is $10/month.</li><li>Raw log access</li><li>Reliable uptime</li></ul>I've looked at <a href="http://www.crystaltech.com/shared.htm">CrystalTech</a> and <a href="http://www.hostmysite.com/adv_host.hms">HostMySite</a> plans, but they don't address the multiple domain issue. I've got 14 domains: 1 active, 1 that desperately needs to be created, 2 that are really burning a hole in my consciousness, 1 that's a great business idea that'll have to wait until after my work project, and 9 that are just cool that I'd like to develop someday. So you can see that this is a very important aspect of hosting for me.<br /><br />[UPDATE: All that build up and I forgot the sales pitch. If I can find a host that offers a reasonable facsimile of the above requirements, then I will spend more time creating the web sites I mentioned and I will convert bblog, PregoBlog, and Found on the Web into non-Blogger blogs with all the beauty and power that implies. And I'll gladly say that you referred me. Just <a href="/contact/?subject=Have+I+Got+A+Host+For+You">let me know</a>. And I'm not above getting free hosting either if you've got your own server and some space&#x2014;I'll gladly tell you of my bandwidth and space needs, which are very reasonable.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (4/3/04): I got a number of good suggestions. Unfortunately, most of them lacked ColdFusion support and I absolutely require that. Otherwise, I would have to learn PHP and I might as well learn Python, Plone, and Zope at that point. Surfing around, I finally found what I'm looking for at <a href="http://www.uplinkearth.com/vhaCoupon.cfm?kbid=1358">Uplinkearth</a>. It's $24.95/month (+$4.95 for CFMX) and I get four full domains. Ten bucks more and I get ten full domains. Rock on!]<br /><br /><br />

<br />The long-awaited (by me, at least) successor to <a href="http://www.fondantfancies.com/shrook/">Shrook</a> has gotten out of the beta stage and hit final today. I've been eagerly awaiting this event because the preview/beta looked really good, but had some chokepoints that I figured the final release would solve. I'll update with my thoughts on this new release.<br /><br /><br />

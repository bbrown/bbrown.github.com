<p>New blogger Guy Kawasaki doesn't fail to deliver. His entry deriding
<a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/mantras_versus_.html">mission
statements in favor of mantras</a> is spot on. Here at Go Daddy,
I've seen neither officially stated anywhere. I'm sure we have a
mission statement somewhere because otherwise we wouldn't be a real
corporation, but I think a corporate mantra is really a Guy invention.</p>
<p>
Without further ado, here's my quick brainstorm of mantras for Go Daddy (if you can think of any better, leave a comment):
</p><ul>
<li>Wal-Mart of software (this is a co-worker's)</li>
<li>Good software cheap</li>
<li>We roll our own</li>
<li>Value-packed domains</li>
<li>One-stop Web shop</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

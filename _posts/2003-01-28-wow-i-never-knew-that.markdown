<br />Wow, I never knew that the <a href="http://www.marykateandashley.com/">Olsen twins</a> were <a href="http://66.111.43.11/reports/2003/WORLD/0194/4332193.html">interested in nanotechnology</a>. Or were <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/people/105186_people22.shtml">worth $76 million collectively</a>. Or <a href="http://66.111.43.11/reports/2003/WORLD/0194/4332193.html">scored 1600s on their SATs</a>. Or that Mary-Kate finally got a <a href="http://mary-kateandashley.com/hip_picks/" title="Bleh, who cares?">puppy</a>.<br /><br />[UPDATE] I reverse DNSed the IP address "66.111.43.11" and it resolves to sp0ofed.com. I've been deceived! Ignore the nanotechnology and SAT perfection links.<br /><br /><br />

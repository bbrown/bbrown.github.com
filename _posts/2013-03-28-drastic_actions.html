I've had a great idea for an iPhone app for a couple months now and even created an Xcode project for it, after spending a bit of time planning it. It's one whose paper equivalent I use nearly every day so having a digital version would be super handy. If I had already made it, it would occupy a spot on the bottom Dock, which holds four apps.

So I deleted one of those apps, leaving an odd and disconcerting Dock. I'm hoping that that irritation will provoke me to actually fill that spot.

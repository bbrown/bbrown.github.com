<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000773.html">This entry</a> by Jeff Atwood made me realize why I like working on <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/blog/landing.asp">Quick Blog</a> so much. It's not just that it mirrors my own interests or that it's challenging on a daily basis. The thing that makes it all so wonderful is that <em>people are using it</em>. As Jeff puts it:
<blockquote>
A smart software developer realizes that their job is far more than writing code and shipping it; their job is to build software that people will actually want to use.
</blockquote>

I'm not turning into some altruist. Be sure that I'm doing what I do because I get paid. But it's enormously satisfying to know that you're helping people find their voice. Every day I see the entry counts grow, the comment counts grow, and the number of fascinating blogs grow. Sure, there are other blogging engines out there&#x2014;but they're paying me (well, Go Daddy) for mine.

<br />I recommended Firebird <a href="2003_06_01_diamonds.cfm#200376350" title="June 2nd is awhile back. Wow, this year is really flying fast.">awhile back</a> and I've just discovered a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/why/">page</a> that tells me my recommendation is sound. There's a lot of really cool stuff there.<br /><br />I especially like the extensibility. There's a browser that will both <a href="2003_06_08_diamonds.cfm#200423559">dynamically incorporate <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> changes</a> as well as <a href="http://www.texturizer.net/firebird/extensions.html#BlockFall">play Tetris</a> and <a href="http://www.texturizer.net/firebird/extensions.html#Cards">Solitaire</a>. What's best, this isn't feature bloat: it's a well-designed plugin architecture and scripting language. Bravo Mozilla!<br /><br /><br />

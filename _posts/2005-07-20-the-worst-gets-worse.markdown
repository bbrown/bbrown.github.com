<br />At my last job, we used a crappy help desk ticketing application called Magic&#x2014;that was anything but. I've complained about it <a href="/blogs/bblog/archives/the-worst.cfm">here before</a>, but <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/forums/38683/ShowPost.aspx">today's Daily WTF</a> indicates that I was only talking about its superficial suckiness. SQL in the query string!?!? How would that even occur to a developer?<br /><br />The SQL injection possibilities are endless.<br /><br /><br />

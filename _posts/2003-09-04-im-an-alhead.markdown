<br />I am mere hours away from attending a <a href="http://www.weirdal.com/">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> concert at the Dodge Theater. I have been a fan of his music since I was a wee one and I've never seen him in concert. Tonight marks the second half of my life, for tonight I see America's greatest songwriter of this or any generation.

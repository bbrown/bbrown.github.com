The issue of income inequality has been a pernicious social problem in
every country, except for the United States. Most nations have resorted to
socialism in order to combat this problem, to no avail. Why is it that
America, long lambasted by its critics and its friends alike for its
incredible wealth, has never experienced social divisions along class
lines to the fundamentality of other nations? Despite the efforts of many
Americans, America has succeeded where others have failed because
Americans have always clung to the clich&eacute; of the American
dream&mdash;pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps, rags to riches, and
the Horatio Alger story. Moreover, Americans have understood the nature
and source of wealth on a scale that other nations have not. This is not
to say that there have not been detractors; in fact, there have been times
in American history when its detractors have succeeded. More and more
people are coming over to the idea that the government should forcibly
redistribute income from the rich to the poor. In order to get a broad
perspective and understanding on these issues, we must understand the
moral premises that underlie them and the practical application of these
premises.

Anyone who believes that the State should take money from one person does
so from within the moral confines of altruism. They may call it
Christianity or Good Samaritanism or any of a host of other names. The
essential nature of the doctrine they are upholding is altruism,
nonetheless. This moral code states that no man has the right to exist for
his own sake, that service to others is the standard of value, and that
self-sacrifice is the highest value and virtue. To use a popular
platitude, you <em>are</em> your brother's keeper. Politically, the
doctrine of altruism lends itself to statism; the State supplanting the
role of "others." You have no rights except that which the State grants
you and your duty is to the State. Therefore, you have no moral right to
your income or your wealth, others do. Since the State is the only
instrument that can achieve the equal distribution of wealth, it is
morally required to seize anything you make over your fair share.

The only consistent moral system that supports the capitalist system is
that of Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand. Capitalism has been
defended for centuries now, but the defense bought into the same premises
as the attackers: altruism. Ayn Rand's is the first system that
successfully integrates an ethics of egoism with the premises of
capitalism. Her premises follow. The Law of Causality obtains. That is,
every action has a cause that has a specific nature which limits the
actions possible. Man, therefore, has a specific nature. Survival is
specific for man in that he must perform a certain set of actions in order
to survive. He cannot acquire nutrition and energy using the method of
survival of the plant, i.e., using chlorophyll. He must get food and
consume it to provide the energy necessary for continued existence. Food,
however, does not just appear in his mouth. He must engage in a certain
species of action, goal-directed action. The goal, in this case, being
life itself. Life is the ultimate value because life is the precondition
of all values and that which all lesser goals are the means.This
goal-directed action presupposes a process of thought, since it is
necessary to detail within the mind the steps necessary to enact in order
to acquire the food. Granted, the process of thought involved in such an
effort is low-level, but it is most clear at this level. Because a process
of thought is necessarily the precursor to any action, we can say that
reason is man's means of survival. A man <em>can</em> act without thought,
but it amounts to mere motion, and a man <em>can</em> think without
action, but it amounts to mere daydreaming. So, more properly, we should
say that reason is man's <em>basic</em> means of survival. From the above,
we can derive the good. If man is goal-directed and life is his ultimate
value, then life must also be the standard of value, of good and bad. That
which furthers man's pursuit of life, the life proper to man, is the good
and that which hinders his quest of life is the bad. Therefore, since man
has a certain means of survival and the good is that which furthers
survival, we can say that which allows reason to flourish uninhibited is
also the good. This is the derivation of the rights to life, liberty, and
property. Man's mind, his means of survival, cannot function if man is
condemned to death at whim, i.e., if the right to life is not secured.
Similarly, man's mind cannot function if its content or expression in
action is limited or restricted, the right to liberty. Finally, man's mind
is inextricable from man's body, they are an inseparable whole. Man must
be able to occupy corporeal space. Moreover, man must be able to own the
fruits of his mind's labor. How can life be pursued if one cannot own or
ingest the food that one has acquired. This also hints at the fundamental
evil, the initiation of force. The initiation of force is the only means
by which man's mind may be limited or constricted. Possession of more
money than someone else does not restrict the right of their mind to seek
out means to even greater achievement than you. The government exists to
secure and protect these three rights. The principle here is: you can do
whatever your mind requires you to do so long as you do not infringe on
other people's right to do the same. The assertion that the government
should change its role from policeman to highwayman is repulsive to the
notion of individual rights and reason. A compulsed mind is not free.

How is a fair and equal distribution of wealth to be achieved in American
society? Sam Pizzigati, in his book <cite>The Maximum Wage</cite>,
believes that "[n]o person in the United States shall be permitted to earn
more than ten times the income earned by any other person."<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a>
People earning less than the maximum wage, but more than the minimum would
pay taxes on a scale from one to ten percent, depending on the distance of
their wage from the minimum. Then, anything over the the maximum wage
would be taxed at a marginal rate of one hundred percent. The rich pay
their fair share and the poor don't have to scrounge for meals. Another
redistribution scheme, promulgated by Milton Friedman, is the negative
income tax. In this system, each taxpayer is allowed a certain amount, a
personal allowance. Any income above this allowance is taxable, same as it
is now. Any income below this allowance is subsidized to raise it up to
this personal allowance. Thus, you've got the welfare system in that
people are given money based on need, but you don't have the bureaucracy
that comes with it. The solution to redistribution most often chosen is
the welfare state. Every nation of the world that is not outright
socialist or fascist has enacted the welfare state, to differing degrees.
The American model of the welfare state guarantees a minimum wage, free
(or cheap) medical care for the elderly and poor, cash payments to the
elderly, the disabled, the unemployed, and poor families. It is based on a
progressive tax, one whose marginal rates increase with income. It was
originally envisioned as  a safety net, whereby those displaced workers or
temporarily poor could use it until they got back on their feet, but has
since grown to become as comprehensive as the modern socialist states of
the United Kingdom and Sweden. In fact, Sweden is heralded as the
representative of equality. It guarantees a job at a living wage, provides
free health care for all, free child care, and, sometimes, free housing
and transportation. It has low unemployment, a high standard of living,
little income inequality, and no overt signs of poverty.

The antipode has never really been enacted. The closest it ever came was
during the Industrial Revolution in America. Freedom was well-respected,
but upheld on unstable ground. There are four things that would have to
occur in order to erase the welfare state. One, repeal the welfare state.
End all aid programs, all handouts, and all social security programs. Two,
eliminate taxation. The forcible robbery of the American citizenry must
cease. To paraphrase Dworkin, a government that does not respect man's
inalienable individual rights is insincere. Third, properly understand
rights. If we do not, the welfare state will be back at the next populist
legislator. Fourth and final, pare government down to its three functions
that protect individual rights: legislature, police, and military. These
three functions are the only proper ones of government. Everything else,
from OSHA to the EPA, must go. Then, and only then, will you have a
government dedicated to the original intent of the Founding Fathers and
respectful of individual rights.

The welfare state and other redistributionist incarnations seek to acquire
what others have produced without following the necessary causal sequence.
They destroy the incentive to produce and undermine the only chance the
poor have of rising above their situation. In a free market, "income is
not distributed, it is produced."<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a>
</p>
<p>
The advocates of an equal distribution of wealth say that the poor have no
way to get out from under the weight of the rich. The very society they
inhabit prevents them from doing so, from the quality of education they
get to the opportunities available to them. Since private individuals and
corporations have not fulfilled their duty of charity, it is up to the
government to compel them to do so.

<br />I agree completely with <a href="http://www.bump.net/">Robert</a>'s <a href="http://www.bump.net/archives/2003_05_01_index.html#200228279">sentiments about iPod v2.0</a>. If this is a temporary oversight, then I can live with that.<br /><br />What I fear is that we're seeing a genuine branch that won't ever get merged&#x2014;kind of like 9.2.1 and 10.2.5. We'll see iPod software versions 2.1 and 1.4, the latter permanently shut out of alarm clockiness and on-the-go playlistery.<br /><br />Makes you kind of want to <span style="cursor:hand;text-decoration:underline;" title="You know, like in that commercial where the lady throws a tire through the window.">go Discount Tire on their ass</span>&#x2014;except that that would hurt an innocent iPod.<br /><br /><br />

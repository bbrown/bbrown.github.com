<br /><a href="">Rafe Colburn</a> <a href="http://rc3.org/cgi-bin/less.pl?arg=6181">asks</a> if <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=287836">this</a> is money well spent and I'd have to say it's amazing the obviousness of the request. It's especially funny that the questioner asked for the response to be removed as soon as he got it. Spammers don't share!<br /><br /><br />

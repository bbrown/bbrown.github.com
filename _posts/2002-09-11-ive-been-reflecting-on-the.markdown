<br />I've been reflecting on the events of last year. I can honestly say that nothing in my life has been affected by the terrorist bombing. Oh sure, airport "security" is heightened and I couldn't pick my wife up at the gate. Other than that, the only change in my life has been a greater awareness of the Middle East and foreign policy.<br /><br />I did not know anyone that died in the WTC or Pentagon bombings. The much-decried trouncing of individual rights has not impinged on me. I am not, however, denying the suffering of those who died and those whose rights were infringed. That is a travesty, especially given the ineffectualness of the security efforts.<br /><br />What's more, I don't see that America has changed much either. Fundamentally, its confidence is not shaken and its economy is sound.<br /><br /><br />

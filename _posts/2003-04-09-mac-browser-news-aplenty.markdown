<br />First, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> is <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/">working hard</a> on <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>. The rumor mill has it that <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=113">public beta 2.0 is due soon</a>! I can't wait. I'm all goose-pimply. Well, no. But I <strong>am</strong> excited.<br /><br />Second, <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniGroup</a> unveiled its <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/3253" title="4.2.">new version</a> of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a>. It features a text area zoom box. Why didn't anyone else ever think of that? That is such a great innovation.<br /><br />Finally, OmniGroup has also unveiled its newest <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/ftp/pub/software/MacOSX/.sneakypeek/">sneaky peek area</a> where they make <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/ftp/pub/software/MacOSX/.sneakypeek/releases/" title="Note also OmniGraffle 3.0!">OmniWeb 4.5</a> available to licensed OmniWeb users. The new sneaky peek release features the preliminary integration of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/webcore/">WebCore and JavascriptCore</a> from Apple. I am downloading it presently and will comment after some use. The <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/ftp/pub/software/MacOSX/.sneakypeek/releases/OmniWeb-4.5sp-ReleaseNotes.html">release notes</a> are available.<br /><br />These are heady browser times on the Mac indeed!<br /><br /><br />

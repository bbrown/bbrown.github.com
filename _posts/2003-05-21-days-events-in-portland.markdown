<br />Today I went to <a href="http://www.powells.com/">Powell's Books</a>, specifically the main <a href="http://www.powells.com/info/places/burnsideinfo.html">City of Books</a> location, and bought a lot of books:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609808346/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>The Onion: Dispatches from the Tenth Circle</cite></a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1579651208/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Essentials of Cooking</cite></a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1570761647/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Serene Gardens: Creating Japanese Design and Detail in the Western Garden</cite></a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0306810964/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>The A List: 100 Essential Films</cite></a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738205435/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Small Pieces Loosely Joined: A Unified Theory of the Web</cite></a></li><br /><li><cite>Oxford Lectures on Poetry</cite> by E. de Selincourt</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805069860/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>The Poetry of Robert Frost</cite></a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399150218/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Hercule Poirot's Casebook</cite></a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394724712/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>The New James Beard</cite></a></li><br /></ul><br /><br />I know what you're thinking&#x2014;"How the hell is he going to get all of those books home?"&#x2014;and I've already thought of that: I have no freaking idea.<br /><br />In other Portland news, I had sushi for lunch. I decided to try something new. Previously, the extent of my sushi experience was California rolls from <a href="http://www.samuraisams.net/">Samurai Sam's</a> so I ordered the combination platter. This smorgasbord of sushi had maybe eight different types of sushi including eel and octopus! The eel was surprisingly good, but I almost puked on the suction cups from the tentacle. Ugh, I'm getting a little choked up thinking about it&#x2014;steamed cartilage is very, very chewy and gives you ample time to ponder exactly what it is that you're chewing.<br /><br />[UPDATE: I'm now quite hooked on <a href="http://www.jambajuice.com/" title="Specifically the Razzmatazz concoction.">Jamba Juice</a>. I only had 15 minutes this morning to make it from my hotel to the JJ store to Corillian. I drove so fast that I actually made it in 9 minutes. That's the depths of my newfound addiction.]<br /><br /><br />

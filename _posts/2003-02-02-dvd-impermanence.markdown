<br />Apparently, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/01/31/1043804519345.html">DVDs aren't the permanent storage they're cracked up to be</a>. This was a major reason why I've been switching from VHS tape to DVD. I had already experienced some severe VHS tape integrity problems and I liked DVDs digital quality/letterboxing format. Now, I'm not so sure.<br /><br />Hopefully, this is just a manufacturing problem affecting only some movies and manufacturers and is not endemic to the format.<br /><br /><br />

<br />First <a href="http://www.google-watch.org/">Google Watch</a>, which beget <a href="http://www.google-watch-watch.org/">Google-Watch Watch</a>. Then <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">Jeremy Zawodny</a>'s <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000751.html">rant</a>. Then <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/">Steven Berlin Johnson</a> <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000085.html">assails</a> Google's methods. Finally <a href="http://microdoc-news.info/">Microdoc News</a> claims that Google is <a href="http://microdoc-news.info/home/BloggerNews/2003/09/15.html/1">tampering</a> with their index to favor their own pages and <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/09/16#When:2:48:50PM">Dave</a> relays it, of course, because it agrees with his anti-Google worldview that he developed after they bought out <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> instead of <a href="http://www.userland.com/">UserLand</a>.<br /><br />I thought that there had to be a perfectly reasonable explanation for the behavior and Simon Willison has <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/09/17/googleConspiracies">nailed</a> it. I don't understand why <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> doesn't get the benefit of the doubt. It doesn't engage in questionable tactics like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> does and it isn't run by some ethically-challenged CEO like <a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a> is, so I don't understand the animosity and suspicion.<br /><br /><br />

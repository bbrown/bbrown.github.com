<br />Those of you developing your own software (*ahem*, <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/">Steve</a>) would do well to read through <a href="http://www.dexterity.com/articles/">this collection of articles</a> on the subject I found via <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/05/07.html">Joel on Software</a>. They're written for game developers, but applicable to everyone.<br /><br />This <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/1034">earlier series</a> from <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> serves a similar purpose but isn't nearly as detailed and helpful to my mind.<br /><br />If you know of any other good articles along these lines, please leave a link in the comments.<br /><br /><br />

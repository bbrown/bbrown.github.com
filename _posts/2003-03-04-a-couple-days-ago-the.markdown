<br />A couple days ago the editors at <a href="http://www.newsscan.com/" title="Subscribe to this!">NewsScan Daily</a> asked for readers who had blogs and I responded with the <a href="http://www.paintinginthepark.com/blog/" title="My pottery studio's blog, run as a service for its patrons">three</a> <a href="http://www.bbrown.info/blogs/bblog/" title="My main personal one">I</a> <a href="http://www.bbrown.info/blogs/vignettes/" title="A stillborn diary of a Vignette implementation project, kept for historical reasons.">run</a>&#x2014;thinking that they would be used for aggregative purposes. Instead, they provided <a href="http://www.newsscan.com/cgi-bin/findit_view?table=newsletter&amp;id=7853">links</a> and my three were half those listed! Holy moly! My traffic is through the roof compared to its normal trickle.<br /><br />So, welcome NewsScan Daily readers to my humble abode on the Net. If I had known, I would have cleaned the place up a bit! If you're not a NewsScan Daily reader, you should be because it is an amazing digest of important news, commentary, and culture. I read it daily, stopping whatever else I'm doing until I read through to the subscription information signifying the end. You may also want to check out another good, though entirely different daily news/tech/culture digest called <a href="http://www.nextdraft.com/">NextDraft</a>.<br /><br /><br />

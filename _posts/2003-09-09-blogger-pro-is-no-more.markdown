<br />Just got an email from Blogger/Google announcing that Blogger Pro is going away. In other words, all of the stuff I paid $35/year for is now available for free from <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>. Well, as a consolation prize, I'll get a Blogger hooded sweatshirt. That's cool enough, I suppose.<br /><br />If I had to guess, I'd say that Google doesn't want two separate codebases to support and maintain. This merge should theoretically allow them to start adding features and good stuff. The motivation behind this move is left unsaid in the email, so my opinion is pure speculation.<br /><br />[UPDATE (9/11/03): The news is <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-5074041.html">everywhere</a> now, even <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/11/009251&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=95">Slashdot</a> has a discussion.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />When I was a kid, I loved books about heuristics&#x2014;rules of thumb, aphoristic laws, and the sort. I've still got probably a dozen of those books and I think I probably checked out every other one at my local library.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.edge.org/">Edge.org</a> asked famous people for <a href="http://www.edge.org/q2004/q04_print.html">their laws</a> and they've got quite a comprehensive collection. I've read through a few, but my love of heuristics has slackened over time. Maybe this will be the catalyst that rekindles my affection for them.<br /><br /><br />

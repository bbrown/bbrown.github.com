<br />Long-time media correspondent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57936-2003Mar31.html">Peter Arnett was fired</a> from his jobs at NBC, MSNBC, and National Geographic for giving an interview on Iraq state television. In the interview, he essentially gave aid and comfort to the enemy by parroting Iraq's propaganda that the war is going badly and that civilian casualties will force America to back down. He also praised the Iraqi Ministry of Information for its liberality towards journalists.<br /><br />Of course, many are <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/24735">trumpeting this as a blow to free speech</a> but it seems like a pretty clear-cut case of the three networks wanting to avoid any appearance of helping the enemy. Arnett says in the linked article that he's "embarassed" but it rings hollow.<br /><br /><br />

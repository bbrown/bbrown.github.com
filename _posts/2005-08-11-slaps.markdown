<br />A hospital in Houston is <a href="http://www.overlawyered.com/archives/002634.html">renaming its tower</a> after a local lawyer. He contributed $25 million to the hospital and so they do what hospitals everywhere do. The twist is that the lawyer in question made his money off medical malpractice suits surrounding breast implants.<br /><br />Doctors at the hospital are petitioning to get the decision reversed, which is refreshing.<br /><br /><br />

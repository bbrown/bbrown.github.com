<br /><a href="http://www.gilest.org/">Giles Turnbull</a> has an excellent article about <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/08/05/outboard_brains.html">notetaking software</a> for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> up at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>'s <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/">MacDevCenter</a>. He calls the software "outboard brains." It's a subject I've been interested in for a long time and have never found an adequate solution for my needs. I'll have to check his recommendations out, I just might find the right app.<br /><br />[UPDATE (8/12/03): More <a href="http://www.atpm.com/9.08/ml.shtml">praise for Xnippets</a>.]<br /><br /><br />

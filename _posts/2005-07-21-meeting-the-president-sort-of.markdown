<br />Today when I was leaving work, I went out the back way since it was closer to where I parked my car. The door is a little sticky so I gave it a good heave. Unfortunately, there was someone just walking up to the other side of the door. More unfortunately, it was <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/">Bob Parsons</a>, Go Daddy's owner. Luckily, I only gave it a slight heave as opposed to my usual slam. I can't imagine what would have happened if I really opened it hard&#x2014;I do know, though, that it wouldn't be a good first impression.<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

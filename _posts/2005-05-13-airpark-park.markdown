<br />Now that I work in the <a href="http://www.scottsdaleairpark.com/">Scottsdale Airpark</a>, I figured that today was the day to start exploring. My previous place of employment was in a prime area to wander around because Papago Park was nearby and the Salt River riverbed was within walking distance.<br /><br />The airpark, on the other hand, is pretty landlocked and commercial. I figured I'd at least get to see some interesting artifacts of the human environment. That was nice, but not fifty yards from my building did I stumble upon my first discovery.<br /><br />Awesome dirt! It's probably an odd quirk of mine&#x2014;growing up as an adventurous boy in the desert&#x2014;but I love dirt. My favorite kind of dirt is the powdery stuff; you know, the dirt that has the consistency of powdered sugar or flour. Because I was at work, I opted not to scoop it up but it gave me some pause.<br /><br />After about a block of walking, I chanced upon <a href="http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Parks/neighborhood/northsight.asp">a Scottsdale municipal park</a>. And it wouldn't be a Scottsdale park without a horse trail and some lumbering equines. I couldn't believe my luck in finding the place and so I proceeded, <a href="http://www.friends-tv.org/zz607.html">Phoebe-style</a>, to run at full tilt across the park's expanse. I checked out the playground for future family gatherings and watched some squirrels frolic.<br /><br />All in a half an hour. Good times.<br /><br /><br />

Oliver Stone's production of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001DJ7PMI/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>JFK</cite></a> in 1991 represented the
final word on the Kennedy assassination for many Americans. Through the
practices and devices available to the filmmaker, Stone was able to create
a convincing, plausible account of the conspiracy to kill President
Kennedy. The assassination has spawned a veritable cottage industry of
conspiracy theory and speculation starting from November 22, 1963. Stone's
<cite>JFK</cite> takes three accounts of the conspiracy and melds them
together in a masterful and nearly seamless plot line. Jim Garrison's
<cite>On the Trail of the Assassins</cite> forms the core of the story,
with additional theories provided by Jim Marrs' <cite>Crossfire</cite> and
John Newman's <cite>Kennedy and Vietnam</cite>. Each of these works had
generated their own controversies before becoming associated with Stone's
<cite>JFK</cite> and engendered even more after the association. The story
they collectively tell is one of conspiracy in the highest echelons of
government, as well as self-centeredness and hawkishness by the military.
Stone planted enough reasonable doubt in the viewer's mind that&mdash;even
though he might blanch at the mystifying government-wide conspiracy&mdash;he
would still believe that the Warren Commission was hiding something and
that some sort of conspiracy existed.
</p>
<p>
Oliver Stone asserted that his movie was historical instead of fiction and
that he was a "cinematic historian" instead of a filmmaker. He claimed
that he was being persecuted by the media, who he argued acted as a
"priesthood" and pretended to be the "sole or privileged interpreters of
our history." Stone further contended that history was "too important to
leave to newsmen."<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a> The clear
implication is that Stone considered himself a historian defending history
from its poseurs. Robert Toplin's <cite>History by Hollywood: The Use and
Abuse of the American Past</cite> takes up Stone's challenge and seeks to
comprehend <cite>JFK</cite>'s role as history and its mercurial director
as historian. Toplin argues that <cite>JFK</cite> would have elicited much
less controversy had Stone kept quiet about his historical aspirations or
defended them as artistic license. A more balanced examination of the
assassination reveals that <cite>JFK</cite> was not a historical work by
any stretch of the imagination. Stone's claims brought that fact to the
forefront and provided a focal point for critics.
</p>
<p>
The enduring legacy of that fateful day in Dallas is amazing. Hundreds of
books have been written, countless documentaries have been filmed, and
many symposia have been convened. The Warren Commission published 26
volumes of testimony, analysis, and evidence yet it could never be
thorough enough for many. Max Holland speculates that the "disbelief
attached to the Warren Report has to be grounded in unfinished business,
some yearning that goes well beyond narrow questions like whether all
pertinent government documents have been released."<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a>
This paper cannot claim to present anything remotely like a definitive
statement on such a well-travelled topic, but it will examine the larger
issue of whether Oliver Stone's <cite>JFK</cite> was a work of history.
The problems raised by Stone and the controversy surrounding
<cite>JFK</cite> rise above the narrow questions of who did what, when
and why.
</p>
<p>
The primary issues raised by Stone are what is history and who gets to
speak for it. The major criticism of Stone's <cite>JFK</cite> is that it
adopted a historical stance without employing a historical methodology.
The historical methodology emphasizes research to discover facts and then
provide an analysis of those facts in order to construct an
interpretation. Such an interpretation invariably examines contradictory
evidence since reality is rarely clean and clear in its facts. Even more
rare is the interpretation that asserts certainty or excludes other
possible interpretations. This occurs because of the messy nature of
evidence&mdash;crucial items are lost forever, contradictory testimony
points in two different directions without any probable resolution, or
time weathers memories, evidence, and artifacts. Stone, on the other hand,
does not engage in any such tempering or qualification. For him, the
matter is crystal clear: the government killed its Commander-in-Chief in
order to escalate the Vietnam War. Never mind that such a conclusion faces
the evidentiary problems inherent in historical work; the evidence
required to prove such a fantastic conclusion would be considerable and
easily thwarted if such a powerful conspiracy existed. The conspiracy
would have to involve a carefully coordinated and precisely executed plan
spanning many federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the
cooperation and silence of hundreds if not thousands of individuals.<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a>
</p>
<p>
Yet such a conspiracy was asserted in <cite>JFK</cite> as fact. It is as
if Stone thought that a conspiracy was self-evident: the details of which
specific agencies, individuals, countries, or criminal organizations were
involved are "narrow questions." There is no qualification by Stone, just
a flurry of open-ended speculation. The result is a mishmash of concretes
and theories that would make a postmodernist's head spin. Coincidences are
used as evidence of conspiracy, or, at least, never considered as
coincidences. The conclusion&mdash;that Kennedy was killed by a
conspiracy&mdash;is foregone and Stone, using Garrison's tome, throws out
concrete after concrete in a shotgun approach to proving his notions. The
viewer, unable to separate fact from fiction thanks to Stone's directorial
skill, gives up and allows that Oswald had to have help.
</p>
<p>
And here we have a crucial difference between Stone and historians.
Historians, presumably, would have seen coincidence and looked for the
simplest explanation that fits the facts. Occam's Razor, which states that
the simplest theory is probably the most correct, is a fundamental part of
the historical method&mdash;at least implicitly. Stone, on the other hand,
weaves fanciful and elaborate theories as to how the simplest explanations
are really what the conspiracy would have you believe. Stone and his ilk
would rather construct convoluted hypotheses than recognize the messy and
contradictory nature of contemporaneous statements and evidence. Some of
the information that came out of Dallas in the week following the
assassination was speculation and contradictory. However, certain things
become apparent based on preponderance and weight. Sure, some people
thought they heard shots coming from fence by the grassy knoll&mdash;but
they can be mistaken. When their testimony is coupled with ballistics
evidence and other products of forensic science, we can see that they were
mistaken. Thus, for Stone and others, no eyewitness account can be
discounted and all must be explained. Any theories or hypotheses
constructed up to that point were subject to recasting and accommodation
of new evidence.
</p>
<p>
In shooting a feature film that relies on fictional devices and dramatized
reenactments, Stone looks at first blush to be yet another Hollywood
director making a big-budget movie. His statements both before and after
the film's release indicate that he viewed the movie differently. In press
conferences, opinion pieces, articles, and interviews, Stone positioned
himself as a historian or "cinematic historian." He defended the film's
historical accuracy in long, point-by-point rebuttals sent out as press
releases and sometimes printed as editorials. He engaged his critics at
every juncture possible: in talk radio interviews, in speeches, in press
conferences. He also railed against the academic establishment that
accused him of historical revisionism and rewriting history.<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a>
Stone's positions exposed him to criticism by historians, both academic
and independent.
</p>
<p>
It is tempting to write off a lot of the criticism by historians as
professional jealousy. A similar reaction&mdash;though considerably less
strident&mdash;greeted filmmaker Ken Burns after he claimed to be a member
of the historical profession. Envy may have motivated some of the
filmmakers' detractors, but it could not possibly explain all of it: there
was just too much criticism from a very diverse group of historians and
scholars. The issue at stake was one of specialization. These historians
perceived that, if people like Stone could call themselves historians,
their hold on history in the public mind was very tenuous. Conceivably,
anyone anywhere could spout out nonsense and call themselves historians.
Since the public is generally deficient in historical skills, this
nonsense could be uncritically accepted. The historical profession,
lacking an accrediting agency, did not have any means of automatically
conferring authority. One could not be a licensed historian and the
various historical organizations were professional in nature.
</p>
<p>
Stone, as we have seen, called himself a historian, even though he
flagrantly violated the historical methodology. Such self-description
cannot be taken at face value and one must wonder how many members of the
general public actually concurred. Ultimately, <cite>JFK</cite> must be
judged on the basis of its comportment with the historical record. This is
the same as any piece of historical work, whether it was produced by a
well-credentialed professor, a doctoral student, or a journalist. There
are plenty of professors and doctoral students who are less objective and
more irrational than any journalist. And the reverse is also true. That is
why historical works must be judged on their own merits, rather than on
the authority and education of the author.
</p>
<p>
That being said, though, works produced by academics do tend to be of
higher quality and of a more scholarly bent than non-historian efforts.
That is due mostly to the specialized training that academic writers
receive. They are taught how to use and understand historical evidence.
They learn how to deal with contradictory records. All of these lessons
make the work more consonant with the messiness of reality. Non-academics
tend to see the world in binary terms&mdash;black and white&mdash;rather
than the subtleties present in such a complex context. Stone <em>qua</em>
artist was perfectly within his rights to present open-ended speculation
about the Kennedy assassination. He crafted a masterpiece of speculative
fiction&mdash;very persuasive and compelling. If he had left it at that,
few would have faulted him. Certainly, historians would have been able to
enjoy the film as entertainment, rather than as an attack on their
profession. As Toplin characterizes it, Stone "fudged the issue [by]
claiming to be both a truth-seeking investigator and an artist who
operated free of the standards that guide historical interpretation."<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a>

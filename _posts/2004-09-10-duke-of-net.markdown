<br />In case you missed it, <a href="http://www.dukepower.com/">Duke Power</a> is <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/appdev/story/0,10801,95419,00.html">giving away</a> its application framework for .NET development. I was intrigued because my work is to the point where we're looking into developing our own application framework for the future. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the project on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a> for the longest time.<br /><br />But I eventually did and it <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/duknetframework/">looks</a> pretty compelling. I've unzipped it but I haven't yet delved into its innards or checked out how well documented it is. I'll maybe put up a review if I do.<br /><br /><br />

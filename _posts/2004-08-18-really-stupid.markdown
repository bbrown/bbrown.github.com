<br />I wrestled a little bit with the <a href="http://www.appleturns.com/scene/?id=4862">issues</a> surrounding Real Networks vs. Apple in the former's reverse-engineering of Apple's Fairplay <acronym title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</acronym>. On the surface, it really does seem to be about iPod owners getting to decide what goes on their iPods. Once you get past this superficial take, it becomes quite obvious that Real is being disingenuous at best and trying to steal Fairplay after Apple refused&#x2014;as was its right&#x2014;to license it to them.<br /><br />As usual, <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net/" title="Easily the best Mac columnist out there.">John Gruber</a> hit the nail on the head in his <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/08/2004_wont_be_like_1984">latest entry</a>, grasping the essentials of this debate and refuting any possible objections with dispatch. There's really nothing I can add here.<br /><br />In the entry, he also linked to <a href="http://www.bynkii.com/">John C. Welch's blog</a> as a reference. I'm a big fan of Welch's writings as well, but I didn't know that he had a blog. Now if <a href="http://siracusa.home.mindspring.com/john/index.html">John Siracusa</a> would start one, then the three Johns would be a formidable blogging triumvirate of Macintosh opinion.<br /><br /><br />

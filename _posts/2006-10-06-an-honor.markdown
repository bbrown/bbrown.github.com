Former co-worker <a href="http://www.davidlevitt.com/">Dave</a> pointed out to me that <a href="http://mvolo.com/">Mike Volodarsky</a> has started a blog using <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/blog/landing.asp">Quick Blog</a>. He's the Program Manager for Microsoft's IIS development team. (And apparently unaware of all the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/">Microsoft blogging resources</a> available to him. Shhhh.)

[UPDATE (1/12/2007): He's <a href="http://mvolo.com/blogs/serverside/archive/2006/12/19/The-self_2D00_hosted-journey-is-finally-coming-to-an-end.aspx">moved</a> to Community Server for obvious reasons. But not before writing up a <a href="http://mvolo.com/blogs/serverside/archive/2006/11/07/Free-no_2D00_hassle-blogging-with-Quick-Blog.aspx">great entry about Quick Blog</a>.]

I've recently switched to <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> for all of my feed reading needs. This is the latest iteration in a long line of trying to find the perfect feed reading experience. Here's what "perfect" means to me in this context:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Readily available so that I can polish off a few items whenever I have a spare minute</li>
<li>Enables me to clear out a batch of unread items easily</li>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Navigable by keyboard for faster reading</li>
<li>Native applications for whatever platform I'm on plus a Web application backend</li>
<li>Sync between work, home, and phone</li>
</ul>
<p>
I subscribe to 250 feeds presently so the primary consideration is staying on top of them. There is a real cognitive weight to having 1,593 unread items and I strongly dislike declaring "feed bankruptcy." So I have spent the last few years testing different options.
</p>
<p>
For most of that time, Bloglines was my go-to solution. It was fast and fairly efficient. But I was never satisfied because it was Web-based, lacked decent keyboard navigation, and required an Internet connection to access at all. I tried Google Reader when it first came out but it <a href="http://bbrown.info/2005/10/reading-google-2.html">left me cold</a>. Since I spent my working life on a Windows XP machine, I <a href="http://bbrown.info/2006/03/re-reblog.html">resigned myself</a> to a Web-based application.
</p>
<p>
Then I <a href="http://twitter.com/billbrown/status/801544769">got a Mac at work</a> and suddenly all of the great Mac OS X feed reading applications were available. I again tried all of the ones I had evaluated at home: NetNewsWire, NewsFire, Shrook, and some others that I can't remember now. I settled on NetNewsWire because of the NewsGator syncing, the native iPhone application, and decent keyboard navigation. I still wasn't completely happy with the set up because the NewsGator Web application is terrible: no keyboard navigation, slower than you'd think possible, and hard to mark items as read.
</p>

As I said earlier, Google Reader is my current solution and I think it's going to stick this time. The Web application has matured substantially since I looked at it four years ago. It lacks a native Mac OS X application but I found a way around that earlier this week, which I chronicled in <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/7615/suggest-to-me-a-better-rss-reader-on-os-x/7634#7634">this Super User answer</a>:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid.app</a>.</li>
<li>Save <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/ui/4283503602-app-icon-64.png">this PNG image</a> (or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/muzo178/2211154209/sizes/o/in/pool-636943@N22/">this higher-resolution one</a>) to your Desktop.</li>
<li>Open Fluid.app and use the Google Reader URL, name, and newly-saved icon.</li>
<li>Launch the Google Reader application from your <code>Applications</code> folder.</li>
<li>Buy <a href="http://www.phantomfish.com/byline.html" title="It's $4.99 and it's totally worth it.">Byline</a> or use the <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/05/brand-new-google-reader-for-iphone.html">really good mobile version</a> of Google Reader (you can <a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2008/10/05/use-web-apps-without-safari-on-iphone-21-os.html">save it</a> to your Home screen to boot).</li>
</ol>
<p>
This setup is very fast, feels native (Fluid.app even displays the unread item count as a badge on the Dock icon), syncs between all environments, has great keyboard navigation, and is always available. I've gotten my total unread item count down to 8 and kept it in double digits for the last week, something I haven't done since I started feed reading.
</p>
<p>
It's refreshing to have that load off my mind.

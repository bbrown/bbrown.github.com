<br />Today I did it. I placed an order for DSL. That's right, Bill Brown is finally joining the broadband revolution.<br /><br />I'm sure most of you reading this have your mouth open in shock. How could someone like me still be using dial-up in this day and age? Two things: 1) I've got a really fast connection at work and 2) I've had a relatively good signal from a neighbor's open wireless network for at least a year.<br /><br />Unfortunately, two things also happened recently that have led me to pony up the dough to get a fast connection: 1) Said neighbor moved a few months ago, leaving me to a regular tying up of our one phone line and 2) the new online banking system that me and my co-worker developed really lends itself to remote administration and maintenance. Rather than drive myself down to work to handle outages (or suffer over a dial-up connection), broadband is going to allow me to do lots more working from home.<br /><br />Why DSL over cable? I've got <a href="http://www.directv.com/">satellite television</a> and the thought of paying a premium because I don't suffer cable really rankles me. Moreover, everyone I've spoken to about broadband&#x2014;with a few suspect exceptions&#x2014;bristles at the mention of <a href="http://www.cox.com/">Cox Communications</a>. Now <a href="http://www.qwest.com/">Qwest</a> is often referred to around here as <a href="http://www.oldskoolphreak.com/a_gallery/qworst_telco.html">Qworst</a> but I've never had a problem. I've got them as my local, cellular, and dial-up provider. As a former Baby Bell, they know something about <acronym title="Quality Of Service">QOS</acronym>. I like the idea of having an unpooled connection to the Internet.<br /><br />What finally cinched it for me was that <acronym title="Very high-speed Digital Subscriber Line">VDSL</acronym> was available. This is <a href="http://www.qwest.com/vdsl/learn/vdsl.html">fiber to the neighborhood</a> and offers much better bandwidth than regular DSL. It's got great upstream speeds&#x2014;768 kbps&#x2014;which makes <acronym title="Voice Over IP">VoIP</acronym> through <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a> a very real possibility.<br /><br />In addition to the VDSL, I'm setting up a wireless network of my own using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007KDVI/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="A steal at $59.99 with a $10 mail-in rebate">Linksys WRT54g</a> access point. I know, I know: why didn't I go <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/">Apple</a>. Two reasons: 1) freaking overpriced and 2) <a href="http://www.sveasoft.com/">Sveasoft</a>. I have been dying to install their <a href="http://www.sveasoft.com/content/view/3/1/">firmware replacement</a> ever since I read about it in an <cite>I, Cringely</cite> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20040527.html">column</a>. It's a lot of power and a lot of interesting options for me to craft the best network I can get.<br /><br />So in a matter of a week, I will finally move into the Information Age on my own and I won't have to rely on an unreliable neighbor's connection or the faithful but sluggish world of dial-up. You'll have to pardon my excitement!<br /><br /><br />

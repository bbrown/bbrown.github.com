<br />I just got back from seeing <cite>Shanghai Knights</cite>. I went in with the expectation that it wasn't going to come close to <cite>Shanghai Noon</cite> in originality or quality. Right on the former, wrong on the latter. It retreads a lot of the same ground, but the chemistry between Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan works&#x2014;unlike the forced pairing with Chris Tucker. The fight scenes are clever and mesmerizing; I can't wait for the DVD so that I can watch them over and over and over (in fact, I'd say the fight choreography surpasses the original movie).<br /><br />That said, there were a few things that really bothered me. Namely Charlie Chaplin, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Sherlock Holmes. The writer tried to be clever&#x2014;along the lines of naming a Chinese in a Western Chon Wang&#x2014;but completely missed the comic line indicating where he should have stopped. It was in the first movie with the original joke. Not terribly subtle: even the children in the theater got it.<br /><br /><br />

I've been using <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> since it came out. I was once an avid <a href="http://obdev.at/products/launchbar/">LaunchBar</a> user but it just couldn't compare to Quicksilver's slick user interface and incredible power. It's the first app I install on any Mac I touch. But whenever I go to <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">Merlin Mann's site</a> I invariably find some completely unexpected trick that makes me realize that I've barely scratched the surface.

This entry about <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2007/03/12/tme-quicksilver-application-menus/">Quicksilver proxy objects and menu items</a> brings the Quicksilver power to bear on an application's menus. So. You. Can. Use. Quicksilver. To. Run. Menu. Items. That. Might. Be. Buried. In. Submenus. O. M. F. G.

If you're constrained to the Windows world, now's the time to switch. Yes, a free app is worth the switch.

<br />I just discovered <a href="http://www.coxandforkum.com/">Cox&amp;Forkum</a>, a site for editorial cartoons by Cox and Allen Forkum. The cartoons are currently about the war with Iraq&#x2014;isn't everything focused on that right now?&#x2014;but that would probably change as time goes on.<br /><br />You may know of Allen Forkum as the artist behind the new covers of <a href="/values/people/aynrand.cfm">Ayn Rand</a>'s books.<br /><br />[UPDATE (9/11/03): <a href="http://www.larrysalzman.com/">Larry</a> reminded me that Nick Gaetano is the artist for Ayn Rand's books. Looking back over my memory, Allen Forkum was the cartoonist for a long-defunct Objectivist publication called <cite>Reality</cite>. Incidentally, those bums never refunded my subscription when they went under.]<br /><br /><br />

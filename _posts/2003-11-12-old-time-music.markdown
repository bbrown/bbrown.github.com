<br />Back before there were CDs, there were records. Wait, those were the LPs (Long Plays). Before that there were the 45s. And before that were the 78s. Before that were the wax cylinders, but you don't hear too much about that.<br /><br />Here's <a href="http://www.honkingduck.com/BAZ/baz_one.php?req=info">701 78s in RealAudio format</a>, music from 1924 to 1946 in genres you've probably never heard about. If you like this, there's also <a href="http://dismuke.org/">Dismuke's Virtual Talking Machine</a>, <a href="http://www.secc.kctcs.net/AppalachianCenter/archives/ward/fiddlers.htm">Ed Ward's Old Time Fiddle Site</a>, <a href="http://www.1001tunes.com/">1001tunes.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.tinfoil.com/">tinfoil.com</a> for those wax cylinder recordings you never knew you wanted.<br /><br />Sometimes you just want the oldest school possible.<br /><br /><br />

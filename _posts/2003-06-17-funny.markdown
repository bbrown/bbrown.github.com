<br /><a href="http://www.downwithwhitey.com/">DownWithWhitey.com</a> reminds me a lot of Chris Rock's skit on Saturday Night Live called <a href="http://search.freefind.com/find.html?id=107282&amp;pid=r&amp;mode=all&amp;query=nat+x&amp;t=s">"The Dark Side with Nat X"</a>. Okay, so it's pretty racially charged but I think it's more tongue-in-cheek than literal. At least, I hope so. Hmm, it's well-designed and conceived if nothing else. And I finally got to see a picture of <a href="http://www.downwithwhitey.com/theman.html">The Man</a>. Oh, and I learned the <a href="http://www.downwithwhitey.com/actionplan.html">action plan for disposing of whitey</a>.<br /><br /><br />

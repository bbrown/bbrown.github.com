<br />I'm watching the <acronym title="MacWorld San Francisco">MWSF</acronym> keynote at the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/biltmore/">Apple Store Biltmore</a> and it's mostly just recap of 2003 so far (except the Xserve G5 and Final Cut Express 2.0&#x2014;got to remember to order that upgrade). I'm sure there's some big stuff coming since it's only the first hour of the generally two-hour speech.<br /><br />While I'm waiting for the good stuff, I'm reading <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,61730,00.html?tw=newsletter_topstories_html">tributes from computing luminaries</a> on the twentieth anniversary of the Macintosh over at Wired News. It's other good stuff.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Didn't have to wait long, as Steve just announced the new version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> and said that it's "blazing fast" for up to 25,000 photos. As someone who's got 4,000 photos, I dreaded using iPhoto because it took <em>forever</em> to load up and it sucked up massive amounts of memory. Can't wait to download. Come to papa!]<br /><br /><br />

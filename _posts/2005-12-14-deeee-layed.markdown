<br />The inevitable delay in deployment has occurred. I guess too many ducks had to be in a row and a couple strayed. Tomorrow afternoon is the new target for when those ducks get back in line.<br /><br />We were shooting for today so that tomorrow's holiday party wouldn't be filled with trepidation and the potential interruption. That's how the cookie crumbles. One of the guys in the deployment meeting said that it wouldn't be a holiday party without a deployment immediately preceding it. That got a knowing chuckle.<br /><br />So tomorrow afternoon look for an entry announcing Quick Blog!<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

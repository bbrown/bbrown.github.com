<br />Thanks to all of you who ordered stuff that I recommended using my Amazon Associates ID! I just got my quarterly report and it was a gangbuster quarter:<ul><li>Total Purchases: $88.17</li><li>Total Referral Fees: $7.81</li></ul>Add all of this to my previous to-date fees and I've broken the $10 mark!! Only $89.93 to go before I'll get a check. Hot damn!<br /><br /><br />

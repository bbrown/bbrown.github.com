<br />Today <a href="/values/people/sandibrown.cfm">my wife</a> joins the Brown Family 29 Club. I couldn't ask for a better wife: she's kind, generous of spirit, demanding, and even-tempered. Oh, she's also beautiful, sexy, and strong-willed. These are all things that I look for in a woman. It's strange, but she's the most mentally healthy person I know&#x2014;completely at ease with her sexuality and her self.<br /><br />We've been married for over ten years now after having been high school sweethearts. I can't say that it's been champagne and roses throughout. We've had our rough spots and we have our rough spots in the present. But I know that I wouldn't want to go through it with anyone else and I can't imagine life without her.<br /><br />I can't wait to start the next phase of our lives together. I think she's really going to shine as a mother because all of her being suggests it. Our kids are going to be very lucky to have her as a mother&#x2014;and me as a father of course&#x2014;and I'm lucky to have such a wonderful person as a co-parent.<br /><br />When life gets me down, she is my rock, my safe harbor. Thank you, Sandi, for everything and I hope your birthday is as special as you deserve!<br /><br /><br />

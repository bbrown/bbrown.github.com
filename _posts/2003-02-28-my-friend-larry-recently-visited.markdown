<br />My friend <a href="">Larry</a> recently visited New York City&#x2014;it's the February 18, 2003 posting (I'd link but he doesn't have permalinks. D'oh!)<br /><br />From <a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/02/030227new_york_son.html">Kottke.org</a>, I visited <a href="http://www.nysonglines.com/">New York Songlines</a>&#x2014;an amazing annotated street-by-street guide to New York. Amazing in its breadth and its information structure using HTML to map the city. I can't imagine how long this must have taken, both to collect all the information and then to build it. For example, check out this sprawling view of <a href="http://www.nysonglines.com/2av.htm">2nd Avenue</a>&#x2014;I'm sure this would mean more if I had ever visited NYC. You get a sense of the size of New York and also the diversity of commerce that Larry mentions.<br /><br />Great site. And it'll probably get better as he adds more songlines.<br /><br /><br />

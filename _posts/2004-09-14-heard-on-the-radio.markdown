<br />I just heard the following advertisement from 1948 on a CD of old radio programs:<blockquote><p>And in our brief intermission, there's just time to consider a matter of utmost importance to every cigarette smoker. How mild can a cigarette be? Smoke Camels and see!</p><p>Prove for yourself what noted throat specialists reported about Camel mildness in a coast-to-coast smoking test. In this test, hundreds of men and women smoked Camels&#x2014;and only Camels&#x2014;for thirty days, an average of one to two packs a day.</p><p>After making weekly examinations of the throats of the hundreds of men and women who took part in this Camel test (2,470 careful examinations in all), the doctors reported not one single case of throat irritation due to smoking Camels. Yes, the doctors reported not one single case of throat irritation due to smoking Camels!</p><p>Make the Camel mildness test yourself. Test Camels in your "T" zone: "T" for taste and "T" for throat. If at any time you're not convinced that Camels are the mildest cigarette you've ever smoked, return the package with the unused cigarettes to the makers of Camels and you will receive its full purchase price plus postage.</p></blockquote>Amazing.<br /><br /><br />

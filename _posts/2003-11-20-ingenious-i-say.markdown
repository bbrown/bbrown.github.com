<br />A guy has put up a <a href="http://www.danvine.com/capture/">page</a> that allows you to see what <a href="http://www.danvine.com/capture/?nowserving=1596">your site</a> looks like in Safari. It uses a 400 MHz iMac running Mac OS X 10.3.1 yet it is surprisingly speedy&#x2014;my requests only took 23 and 25 seconds. It does this through web services, shell scripts, AppleScript, and Python. Wonderful idea, pretty good execution.<br /><br /><br />

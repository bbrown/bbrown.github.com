<br />Kohler's got a new line of interesting <a href="http://www.us.kohler.com/onlinecatalog/suites_collections_details.jsp?item=6838502&amp;prod_num=Purist+Suite&amp;module=Suites+%26+Collections&amp;frm=1">bathroom fixtures</a> called the Purist Suite. The most interesting one to me is the <a href="http://www.us.kohler.com/onlinecatalog/detail.jsp?frm=1&amp;module=Purist+Lavatories&amp;item=6406302&amp;prod_num=2313">Purist Wet Surface Lavatory</a>, which is a flat surface with a surrounding moat. The sink is thus liberated from the tyranny of the basin. Sure, this will never replace the kitchen sink but it does transform the handwashing experience into something novel and fresh.<br /><br />One of my favorite things is a fresh approach, a novel take on a mundane activity that enhances the experience aesthetically or practically. You don't get them very often, but they're something to treasure when you do. [from <a href="http://www.gamegirladvance.com/zine/200307play/purist_water_play.html">Justin Hall</a>]<br /><br />[UPDATE (7/31/03): I've added a <a href="/lists/">list</a> category entitled <a href="/lists/thinkingoutsidethebox.cfm">"Thinking Outside the Box"</a> that will serve to feature just this sort of innovative design and approach. If you've got something to include, please include it in the comments or <a href="/contact/?subject=Thinking+Outside+the+Box">email</a> me.]<br /><br /><br />

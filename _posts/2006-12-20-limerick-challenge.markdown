My boss's boss issued a call for limericks around the theme of software engineers or engineering. Naturally, I was intrigued. Here are my entries thus far:
</p>
<blockquote>
There once was a dev named Bud Tharpe<br />
Who could crank out code like a harp<br />
His language of choice was VB<br />
But his friends mocked him you see<br />
Because he just couldn't quite see sharp.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A wizened lead named O'Malley<br />
Was checking the bug count, the tally<br />
Evergrowing, it was<br />
Scratching chin fuzz<br />
He wondered if it was time for a rally.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A developer was hit by a bus<br />
It caused an immediate fuss.<br />
Did he check in?<br />
His release was when?<br />
All his base truly belong to us.
</blockquote>

Are they any good? Well, they follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_%28poetry%29">form of a limerick</a> and a couple of them have punch lines. Hey, it might get me a free lunch so they're good to me.

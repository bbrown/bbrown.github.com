<br />In my class we're working in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/">VisualBasic</a>. What a wretched language! It's not as bad as <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/">AppleScript</a>, but it's verbose and seemingly without structure (or the kind of structure I'm used to in <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a>). Don't even get me started about the Studio versus <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a>! I'll grant, however, that it's a far sight better than <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/script56/html/vbscripttoc.asp">VBScript</a>.<br /><br /><br />

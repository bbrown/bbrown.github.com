<br /><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">FireFox 0.9</a> is out now and it seems like a pretty solid release. Unfortunately, it disables all of your old extensions and makes you re-install them. That's normally a pain, but I see it as a chance to reevaluate some of the cruft and detritus that gets installed on a lark.<br /><br />And that's a good thing because doing it led me to discover <a href="http://www.chrispederick.com/">Chris Pederick</a>'s <a href="http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/">Web Developer</a> extension. I couldn't possibly do it justice by explaining its <a href="http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/features/">features</a> or pointing at specific <a href="http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/screenshots/">screenshots</a>. You need to go there and read through the site. Or, better still, install it into your FireFox.<br /><br />Don't have FireFox? What are you, an Internet Explorer user? Ditch that virus-ridden, stagnant crap and get a real browser. Makes me wish that <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a>, my favorite browser, had gone with Gecko/Mozilla like it was originally planning. Oh well.<br /><br /><br />

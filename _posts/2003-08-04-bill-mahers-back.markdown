<br />I watched <cite>Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher</cite> when it was on <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/">Comedy Central</a>. When the show made the jump to <a href="http://www.abc.com/">ABC</a>, it started pulling its punches and didn't last very long&#x2014;literally, the show went from an hour to thirty minutes. I would still watch it on ABC occasionally, but only for the monologue, which had retained its zest and spiciness.<br /><br />Happily, <a href="http://www.safesearching.com/billmaher/">Bill Maher</a> is back with a <a href="http://www.safesearching.com/billmaher/blog/">blog</a> and it's just like the monologue I miss. This <a href="http://www.safesearching.com/billmaher/blog/archives/000010.html">entry</a> on Madonna is hilarious, but there's some quirks in his HTML. Why do I get the feeling that this site is all Bill? If it's not, then he needs to get someone new.<br /><br /><br />

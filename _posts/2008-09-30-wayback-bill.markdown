Google's made their <a href="http://www.google.com/search2001.html">2001 index</a> available for a month to see what the Web was like back when Google was first starting out. It was like a trip down memory lane: there I am at <a href="http://www.google.com/search2001/search?q=bill+brown&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search">#7</a> in a search for my name.
</p>
<p>
Oh yes, I was on the Web since maybe 1996 back before there were blogs. We used to call them home pages, kiddos, and I called mine <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011217182917/www.public.asu.edu/~bbrown/">The Bill Brown Information Center</a>. It used hover effects on the links and everything. It also reveals that I have loved yellow and blue for at least a decade now.

It's worth a look see: I used to have all of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011124172341/www.public.asu.edu/~bbrown/writings.html">my essays available</a>, exhaustive lists of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011124172913/www.public.asu.edu/~bbrown/favorites.html">my values</a>, and a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011103135832/www.public.asu.edu/~bbrown/bio.html">funny bio</a> that is just so <em>me</em>. It's also interesting to note that back then Google and Northern Light were tied as my favorite search engines.

Man, I was so cool!

[UPDATE: Ooo, there's also this Bill Brown-designed <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011223141014/www.asu.edu/clubs/objectivism/">club Web site</a> that brings back a wave of nostalgia. I loved that font!]

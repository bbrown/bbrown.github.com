<br />As of midnight, I will have worked 83 hours since Monday, 9/12. If I work 15 hours a day through Wednesday and take a relaxing 12-hour day on Thursday, that'll put my 11-day total (9 official business days) at 140 hours. Yep, that's a personal best!<br /><br />The funny thing is, I haven't experienced any of the deleterious effects that I've had in previous crunches. I think it's because this is a very short burst instead of a long, draining marathon.<br /><br /><br />

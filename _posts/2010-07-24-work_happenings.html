I haven't written about work in a very long time. It is really a shame, too, because I have done so much in the 18 months or so since my last blog entry about my job. I hit the five-year mark in May, so I'm now officially an old timer.
</p>
<p>
Let's see. I worked on <a href="http://app.mysmartspace.me/">My SmartSpace</a>, a widget dashboard application, and the iPhone version of that (both native and Webified). I developed <a href="http://www.video.me/">Video.me</a>, a video sharing site tailored to fill in the gaps that YouTube leaves. I've also joined an internal initiative called the Product Sponsorship Team, which helps guide the direction of a select group of products&mdash;in my case I'm on the Calendar team.
</p>
<p>
Yes, that's about it. It doesn't sound like too much when you boil it down to a paragraph but it has kept me plenty busy. Busy enough to neglect a lot of my online presence, aside from <a href="http://bbrown.info/tweets/">Twitter</a>.
</p>
<p>
My current role is a developer affiliated with our <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/SocialMedia/social-media.aspx">Social Media Team</a>. They are a great bunch of people and I am truly enjoying my work. In many respects, I feel like it is a continuation of my work on <a href="http://bbrown.info/2008/05/three-years-of-going-daddy.html">the Gadgets Team</a>: I am managing a dozen or more projects in various states of development and I have a considerable amount of input into what I work on.
</p>
<p>
Basically, I do whatever needs doing for our social networking efforts. I advise various teams within Go Daddy about how to get the most out of Facebook and Twitter's APIs. It's interesting and wildly varied.
</p>
<p>
And sometimes I get called on to do something completely off the wall:
</p>
<p>
<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/KqTDvw0kg5I&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/KqTDvw0kg5I&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
</p>
<p>
I think it would have worked better without the eye makeup, but that wasn't my call to make. It turned out amazing and I can't believe how well Go Daddy Productions did with what the footage they shot.

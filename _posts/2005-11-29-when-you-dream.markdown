<br /><a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051124.html">Google Box</a>: Cringely's new column on what Google's up to is out. I thought he was stretching for the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051117.html">datacenter-in-a-shipping-container column</a>, but this one is ridiculous. I'm glad that it's not just Mac fans who <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0511macmini2.html">ascribe big dreams</a> to their mothership.<br /><br /><br />

<br />If you're a fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000541TL/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link">urban legends</a>&#x2014;ugh, not that one&#x2014;then you've got to be familiar with <a href="http://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a>. If you're not, go there right now and I'll see you in an hour or two.<br /><br />Now that you're back, go read this <a href="http://www.ojr.org/ojr/glaser/1059692646.php">interview</a> with one of the maintainers of the site to get an insight into what it takes to keep such a thorough site up and fresh. I have a lot of respect for those two. The two are very good writers and they've created a site that is just as valuable of a reference as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a>. Okay, well, maybe not as valuable but it's pretty close.<br /><br /><br />

I read about the virtues of logging what you do all day <a href="http://lifehacker.com/189772/geek-to-live--quick+log-your-work-day">long ago</a>, but a recent article re-kindled my interest. (Sadly, I can't locate that blog entry and it was a very good one.)
</p>
<p>
On Quicksilver, it was <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/11/21/qs-redux">rather easy</a> to accomplish a digital work journal. But I don't use Quicksilver any longer&mdash;I've converted wholly to <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" title="I paid for the Power Pack. That's saying something.">Alfred</a>. It's almost as perfect as Quicksilver; I miss the large-type view and some of the gratuitous animations, but it has the benefit of being usable.

My first order of business was to figure out how to append a message containing an automatically generated timestamp to the end of a text file. This was surprisingly harder than I thought. There really wasn't any decent shell scripts I could find via Google and the searches yielded a lot of ways to time stamp a log file.
</p>
<p>
Here's what I ended up cobbling together:
</p>
<p>
<code>
#!/bin/bash<br />
echo "$(date +%Y-%m-%d/%T): $@" >> ~/Dropbox/PlainText/Work/Work\ Log.txt<br />
</code>
</p>
<p>
This produces a line like "<code>2011-05-30/13:13:00: Testing script</code>" when you enter "<code>./work.sh Testing script</code>" on a Terminal prompt. That's exactly what I want to log and putting it in that location syncs it automatically with Dropbox and makes it available to <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/plaintext" title="Really beautiful text editor">PlainText</a> on the iPad and iPhone.
</p>
<p>
Now I just needed to make it easy to use from Alfred. I originally created a bash alias called "work" so I could just type "<code>> work Test script</code>" into Alfred. Then I discovered a <a href="http://www.dirtdon.com/?p=886">helpful tip</a> about a new Alfred feature: Terminal Shortcuts.

<p>
It works like a charm!

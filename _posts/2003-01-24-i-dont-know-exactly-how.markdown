<br />I don't know exactly how to categorize <a href="http://www.coin-operated.com/projects">this site</a>. At first, I thought it might be some sort of modernist <a href="http://www.mle.ie/~jonah//projects/searchengine.html">"art"</a> and then I thought it might some sort of <a href="http://www.mle.ie/~jonah//projects/clicks.html">community</a> <a href="http://www.mle.ie/~jonah//projects/mousetraces.html" title="I actually get this one.">development</a> <a href="http://www.mle.ie/~jonah//projects/clipit.html" title="I'm not sure I want people to see what's in my clipboard; I use it a lot.">project</a>. In the end, I filed it away under "neat."<br /><br /><br />

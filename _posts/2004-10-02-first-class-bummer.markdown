<br />I recently ordered some <a href="http://photo.stamps.com/">PhotoStamps</a> with pictures of The Girls and they turned out to be adorable! Unfortunately, that service is at the <a href="http://photo.stamps.com/thankyou/">utter mercy</a> of a <a href="http://www.usps.gov/" title="They try to fake it by redirecting to a .com address, but they're .gov all the way.">legally-enforced monopoly</a>.<br /><br />That's what happens when you build your business off the caprice of an monopoly.<br /><br /><br />

"All I ask is that you restrict them to 'layout-only' check-ins. In other words, if you want to do some source code reformatting <em>and</em> change some code, please split it up into two check-ins, one that does the reformatting and the other that changes the code." &#x2013; Raymond Chen, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/10/30/9023340.aspx">"If you're going to reformat source code, please don't do anything else at the same time"</a>

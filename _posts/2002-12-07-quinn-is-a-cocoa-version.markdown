<br /><a href="http://jenner.rz.tu-ilmenau.de/~siha-in/software.html#quinn">Quinn</a> is a Cocoa version of Tetris for Mac OS X. I'm a Tetris fan from way back. If you use Mac OS X, you must get this program. Best of all, it's completely free and small in size.<br /><br />If you're not using <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" title="I don't envy you!">Mac OS X</a>, then you'll just have to look at this <a href="http://jenner.rz.tu-ilmenau.de/~siha-in/screenshot-qu.html">screen shot</a> though it doesn't begin to capture its greatness. The pieces do a soft little bounce when you drop them, the keyboard control is customizable, the high scores contain time stamps, and the game automatically pauses when it loses focus. It is truly a thing of beauty.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is very addictive and it beckons to me as I do my paper: "Bill, press command-space and type TET into <a href="http://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html" title="Best money I've spent (besides Mac OS X, of course)">LaunchBar</a>. Just for a second. You know you can beat your high score of 17,750."<br /><br />I've got to get this monkey off my back. Maybe I should delete its entry in LaunchBar.<br /><br /><br />

<br />For my reference, <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/06/17/iphoto2.html">How to Manage Large Libraries with iPhoto 2</a>. I've got well over 3,500 photos in my library and it's becoming unwieldy for Thor, my 500 MHz PowerBook G4. I've been putting off any sort of solution because my inner librarian/historian thinks that every photo should have both a title and a comment. I know, just call me <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~widmeyer/sisyphus.html">Sisyphus</a> but I'm crazy like that.<br /><br /><br />

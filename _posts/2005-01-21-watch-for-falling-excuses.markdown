<br />I knew that it had been quite some time since my last blog entry, but a quick trip to <a href="http://technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbrown.info%2Fblogs%2Fbblog">Technorati</a> revealed that it's been 64 days. That is, as far as I can remember, the longest I've gone without blogging since I started. Well, it hasn't really been <em>no</em> blogging: I've posted over 150 entries at <a href="http://www.foundontheweb.org/">Found on the Web</a> and probably a dozen at <a href="/blogs/prego/">PregoBlog</a>.<br /><br />I was trying to come up with a good, reasonable excuse for why I haven't blogged here lately but there's really nothing singular. It's been a whole bunch of time sucks that collectively have sapped me of the will and the time to write here (in no particular order):<ul><li>Work: we just deployed the new version of our online banking system <a href="https://epal.desertschools.org/">ePAL</a> a couple of weeks ago and that entailed probably about forty hours of overtime in preparation and deployment and the last couple of weeks have been a blur</li><li>The Girls: come on, how could I not spend every available second enjoying them?</li><li><cite>Law and Order</cite>: sorry to say, but I have been watching at least an hour of that show every day and sometimes more.</li><li>Procrastination: I've been putting off doing a lot of important things and that has really required a serious focus on mundane tasks. I guess blogging would have worked well, but dishes seemed more pressing.</li></ul><br /><br />There you go. Those are my excuses. I hate being fashionable and trendy; there's been a spate of blogger <cite>mea culpa</cite>s lately. I even procrastinated blogging this pathetic excuse of a post: I was planning on doing this on New Year's Eve.<br /><br />Here's to gumption, may I once again be reacquainted with you!<br /><br /><br />

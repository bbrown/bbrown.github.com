<br />Apparently, there's an independent (read: non-Clear Channel) radio station <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/issues/2003-09-18/feature.html/1/index.html">operating mysteriously</a> out of Florence. It's commercial-free (for the last eighteen months), oddly-formatted and tunable as far as 93 miles west of Phoenix. It's also unclear who owns it and who's running it. It's call sign is KCDX and you can tune it in at 103.1. No Hard Harry, though.<br /><br /><br />

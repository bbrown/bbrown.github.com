If you've got any responsibility for an API, please <span style="font-weight:bold;">please</span> please do not break your API. OOP has a lot of neat things like overloads, encapsulation, and, hell, class name changes to make it easy for you to not completely screw over those downwind (metaphorically speaking) of you.<br />

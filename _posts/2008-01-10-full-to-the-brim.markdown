<p>I put 4 GB of RAM in my MacBook and 2 GB of RAM in my iMac. I don't know why I hesitated for so long in spending the $150! Everything is so zippy and I can have many, many applications open at the same time without worry. Now I just need to sell back all these 512 MB RAM cards I seem to have accumulated over the years&#x2026;</p>

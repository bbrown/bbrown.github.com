<br />It appears that no comments can be posted here without my approval. I have no idea why this is so since I've completely turned off any such requirements. I'm running MovableType 3.17 for this blog and I had no such problems with 2.661.<br /><br />If you want to leave a comment, it won't appear immediately. I really want it to appear immediately, but MT won't let me fulfill my wishes. Until I can move to TextPattern, I'm going to have to live with this. (Luckily, this shouldn't be a problem since I've had 140 comments total in the four years I've been offering up my blog.)<br /><br /><br />

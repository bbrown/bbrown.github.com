<br />A <a href="http://www.mistergin.net/">co-worker</a> sent me a link to a <a href="http://cgi2.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback&amp;userid=phoneloser-rbcp&amp;page=1&amp;items=25">feedback page on eBay</a> that is hilarious because it mocks the inane comments typically left after an auction is successfully concluded.<br /><br />The user audaciously (and sometimes spectacularly) derides the spelling and enthusiasm of the feedback provider in responses&#x2014;a feature I wasn't aware existed on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>. Funny stuff!<br /><br /><br />

<br />These <a href="http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/index.php?module=prodreviews">sensitive documents found</a> via Google searching were a real eye opener. I know that Google indexes everything that's publicly accessible; I guess I just never realized that people search for that stuff.<br /><br />If you are at all responsible for web application or web server security, you must go through these and make sure that your charge isn't so readily available.<br /><br /><br />

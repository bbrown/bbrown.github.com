<br /><a href="http://www.news.com/">News.com</a> has an article up this morning about the RSS controversy that strikes a tone I haven't seen since the <a href="2003_07_06_diamonds.cfm#105785229580287939">brouhaha</a> over <a href="2003_07_06_diamonds.cfm#105794249682299390">Winer Watcher</a>. <a href="http://www.tbray.org/">Tim Bray</a>, quoted in the article, suggests that the author was <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/23/NewsSnicker">baiting</a> him. I didn't see any similar explanation for Dave's comments from <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave</a>. Interesting.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Dave's got a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2136">letter</a> to all of those interviewed in the article and carbon-copied to the author. It's an extremely weird statement though very insightful into Winer's personality, especially the part that starts "I endorsed Pie/Echo/Whatever, maybe you guys could suck in your breath and make some kind of statement about RSS&#x2026;." It's conciliatory though insulting, pleading yet demanding.]<br /><br /><br />

<br /><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! News</a> <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=528&amp;ncid=528&amp;e=7&amp;u=/ap/20030724/ap_on_bi_ge/earns_sony">reports</a> that beleaguered computer maker Sony's second quarter profits are down 98% from last year's quarter. Better enjoy those TVs while you can, for who knows how long they'll be available.<br /><br />(For the irony-challenged, this is a tongue-in-cheek reference to industry pundits seizure of any slippage in Apple's fortunes as an indication of its impending demise. By the way, if you're irony challenged, you should probably go somewhere else because I revel in irony 'round these parts.)<br /><br /><br />

<br />Wow, I got <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/kbase/index.cgi?area=3126">this month's Dreamhost newsletter</a> today and I excitedly opened it. The newsletter isn't your standard fare: it's chock full of cool new features and promotions in a tone that's often witty and always delightful (it runs a close second to the utterly hilarious <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/listinfo/omninews">OmniNews</a> in the excellence in corporate communications awards).<br /><br />This month was no exception. Not only did I find out that they've now got <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href="http://www.zend.com/zend/optimizer.php">Zend Optimizer</a> installed, they also took a cue from <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">Gmail</a>'s ever-increasing storage limit. Every week, my bandwidth goes up by 2 GB (starting from an already-generous 192 GB per month) and my storage increases by 60 MB (again from a generous 7.6 GB). And they made it retroactive to when I first signed up back in November 2004.<br /><br />This is on top of a huge number of excellent features, great support, and excellent uptime. I'm slowly moving everything over to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?wcbrown">Dreamhost</a> from <a href="http://www.uplinkearth.com/">UplinkEarth</a>. It's that good. If you sign up, please tell them I referred you by clicking on <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?wcbrown">this link</a> or using "<strong>wcbrown</strong>" as your referral code. I'll get $97 towards my hosting and it'll cost you nothing extra. I've already referred several hundred dollars worth since I started and I haven't heard any major complaints.<br /><br /><br />

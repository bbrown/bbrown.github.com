<br />There's a fascinating look at the <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/2/15/71552/7795">Win2k source code comments</a> over at <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/">Kuro5hin</a> today. I've written plenty of source code (only several thousand lines as opposed to tens of millions) but I've never commented my source code like they have. I guess I just operate in a very different corporate culture than Microsoft's.<br /><br />My comments amount to explaining why I made choices I did, how a particular section works, and the purpose of different areas. They are at times humorous, mostly sterile, and never profane. I always assume that my co-workers are going to be reading them and that my boss might see it someday. I stay away from the redundant mode of commenting and try always to craft self-documenting code.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I never weighed in on the whole <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/0418piestewa18.html">Squaw Peak controversy</a> as it was unfolding because I didn't have the time to prepare a thoughtful, well-reasoned response.<br /><br />I still don't have time, so don't expect anything now. I just want to go on record as saying that the renaming of the <a href="http://www.sr51.com/">Squaw Peak Parkway</a> as the Piestewa Peak Parkway will never capture the public mind and that I propose that we call it <strong>the Triple-P</strong> for convenience&#x2014;spread the word. If it catches on, you read it here first.<br /><br />In related news, I just noticed that the new <a href="http://www.dot.state.az.us/ROADS/rfs/sr51/01sr51.htm">SR-51&#x2013;L101 interchange</a> completion date has been <a href="http://www.sr51.com/FAQs.htm#1.%20%20When%20will%20SR51%20connect%20to%20the%20101?">moved up to June 2003</a>. My quality of life will improve significantly with this glorious event.<br /><br /><br />

I've been searching for the perfect word to describe Barack Obama fanatics. Portmanteaus seemed to be the perfect neologistical type but all the ones I have found were unsatisfying to pronounce. "Obamaniac" was the closest but it just doesn't work as a word and I've seen too many of them co-opt it for themselves. I don't disparage people who like it.

While driving home from dinner tonight, I came up with a doozy. With a sigh of relief at the conclusion of a long, tiring expedition, I offer up <strong>Obamaton</strong>. Looking over the results at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=obamaton">Google</a> and <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=obamaton">Twitter</a>, I cannot lay claim to originality but at least I'm well clear of clich&#xE9;.

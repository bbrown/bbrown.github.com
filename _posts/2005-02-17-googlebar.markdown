<br />Google's got a <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/T3/index">new toolbar version</a> out and it's got a lot of nice features. Of course, I'm a Mac guy at home so I can't use any of them and a Firefox user at work so I can't use it there either. It's still nice because it gives some of my friends and co-workers the chance to do stuff that I can do in Firefox with some small effort (keywords and such) which aren't really possible with Internet Explorer.<br /><br />Of course, the <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a901d305-2100-48f2-a938-97185591fb5d">Google</a> <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/02/17#When:5:55:35AM">haters</a> are out in force. They blithely drop any context in an effort to smear Google. For example, Microsoft's SmartTag was to be an OS-wide feature that was present unless a user turned it off or the site developer included a special tag in his page to disable it. Google's AutoLink isn't automatically on by default and can be turned off by clicking on the AutoLink button. A user has to actually download the toolbar and then they have to click on the AutoLink button to create the links to Google properties.<br /><br />That makes a lot of difference in my mind since it's akin to downloading a Firefox extension that manipulates site content. The user has to make quite a few decisions before it does its thing. Microsoft's feature required quite a few decisions to make it stop.<br /><br />[UPDATE (2/27/05): Winer's kept up a pretty steady pace of complaining this week. Thankfully, someone's posted an <a href="http://cheerleader.yoz.com/archives/001927.html">excellent entry</a> defending Google and a similarly <a href="http://cheerleader.yoz.com/archives/001928.html">excellent reply</a> to his response.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (2/28/05): Someone went ahead and crafted a <a href="http://groovymother.com/archives/2005/02/28/dave_winers_wor.html">Javascript bookmarklet</a> to transform content on <a href="http://www.scripting.com/" rel="nofollow">Scripting.com</a> in an absolutely hilarious manner. <em>Bing!</em>]<br /><br />[UPDATE (3/4/05): Finally, some well-reasoned and moderate comment on the controversy over at <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/3/3/153759/8577">Kuro5hin</a>.]<br /><br /><br />

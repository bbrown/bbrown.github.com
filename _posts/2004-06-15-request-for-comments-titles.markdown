<br />I've been using the same basic template for a few years now and I'm thinking that I might want to freshen it up a bit since I'm now a <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MovableType</a> guy. My wife suggested that I use entry titles, but I've never really liked the implementations I've seen. You may not know it, but I've been using titles for years&#x2014;they're available in my <a href="feed://www.bbrown.info/blogs/bblog/atom.xml">syndication</a> <a href="feed://www.bbrown.info/blogs/bblog/index.xml">feeds</a>.<br /><br />So, in the comments, please leave your vote whether or not I should include titles and, optionally, suggestions for implementation or links to sites that don't have gaudy, obtrusive titles.<br /><br /><br />

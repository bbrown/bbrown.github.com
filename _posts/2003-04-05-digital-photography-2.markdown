<br />I'm an avid taker of digital pictures and I'm always looking for ways to get better. I recently found a site dedicated to just that end: <a href="http://www.takegreatpictures.com/">TakeGreatPictures.com</a>. The site features regular columns on various topics, including <a href="http://www.takegreatpictures.com/digital/">digital photography</a>. Check it out.<br /><br />[UPDATE (1/8/04): Just found an interesting online book on <a href="http://www.zuga.net/freelessons/zeltsman/jzch1.shtml">classic portraiture</a>. It's decidedly dated, but its subject matter is timeless.]<br /><br /><br />

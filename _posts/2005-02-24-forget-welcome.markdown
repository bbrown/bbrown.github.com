<br />Sorry about the lack of updates. I've been working feverishly on migrating this beast to <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/">TextPattern</a> and watching <cite>Law and Order</cite>. (Last night, Sandi had enough after two and a half episodes: she said that they're all the same. I know, I don't understand her either sometimes.) I'll post something tonight or tomorrow about the change from using WordPress and the decision involved.<br /><br />I'm breaking radio silence because of this <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/cubegoodies/toys/6806/">"There's No Place Like 127.0.0.1" door mat</a>. How cool is that!<br /><br /><br />

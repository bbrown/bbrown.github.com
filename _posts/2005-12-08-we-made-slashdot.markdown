<br />I checked out <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot.org</a> this morning and saw Go Daddy in one of the main stories. Awesome! Err, <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=170621">not so much</a>.<br /><br />I know some people on the shared hosting team and I'd have to say that, if it's our problem, it will be fixed soon&#x2014;if it hasn't been already.<br /><br />[UPDATE: On the other hand, <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=1235522#1235522">plenty</a> of <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=1236967#1236967">people</a> in the <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=244605">Apple Discussion thread</a> on this subject are having the same problem but on different hosts.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 2: In talking with some of my coworkers, the problem is that Safari is following the relevant spec exactly while the other browsers are forgiving. Interesting.]<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

<p>
I'm going to make a frank confession here.
</p>
<p>
I watch reality shows.
</p>
<p>
I watch a lot of them. Way too many, in fact. I watched <a href="http://www.fox.com/joem/" title="Official site"><cite>Joe Millionaire</cite></a> last night. I'll watch <a href="http://abc.abcnews.go.com/primetime/bachelorette/" title="Official site"><cite>The Bachelorette</cite></a> tomorrow and likely <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor6/" title="Official site...they're up to 6 already!?"><cite>Survivor</cite></a> on Thursday. I enjoyed every season of <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race3/"><cite>The Amazing Race</cite></a> and will probably watch the <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race4/">next one</a>, too. Amazingly&#x2014;to me at least&#x2014;I find myself constantly watching inspid dating shows like <a href="http://www.blinddatetv.com/" title="Official site"><cite>Blind Date</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.the5thwheeltv.com/" title="Official site"><cite>The Fifth Wheel</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.shipmatestv.com/" title="Official site"><cite>Shipmates</cite></a>, and <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/ShowMainServlet/showid-2654/" title="Unofficial site...that's not good news when you don't even have an official site."><cite>Rendez-View</cite></a>.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, I watch a lot of non-reality TV and a lot of movies as well. I watch <a href="http://www.snpp.com/" title="Best. Site. Ever."><cite>The Simpsons</cite></a> and <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/vernon/www/vandelay/" title="Vandelay Industries Home Page"><cite>Seinfeld</cite></a> nearly every night. I also read extensively and surf widely. But I find the reality TV watching to be the odd man out, so to speak.
</p>
<p>
What is it about those shows that makes me want to watch them? I'm <a href="../../values/people/maxfieldparrish.cfm" title="Maxfield Parrish, definitely a romantic realist">not</a> generally a naturalist in <a href="../../values/people/franklloydwright.cfm" title="Frank Lloyd Wright, not a naturalist">my</a> <a href="../../values/people/aynrand.cfm" title="The antithesis of naturalism in art">artistic</a> <a href="../../values/people/scottjoplin.cfm" title="Music is difficult to classify, but he's always struck me as a romantic at heart.">tastes</a>. I've never been one for <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2000/05/10.html" title="Dictionary definition of term"><cite>schadenfreude</cite></a> or envy&#x2014;note the conspicuous absence of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Fear_Factor/" title="Official site"><cite>Fear Factor</cite></a> or some of the more horrible Fox specials. What's even more curious is my near-total lack of interest in the lives of most people. I'm beginning to think that I may be more interested in psychology than I thought. Perhaps, subconsciously, I've come to view these shows as raw data for observing situations that I will probably never personally experience.
</p>
<p>
After all, I'll probably never be stranded on a deserted island with a group of strangers, choosing a <a href="../../values/people/sandibrown.cfm" title="Got one and quite happy with her">wife</a> among a slew of strangers, or even dating indiscriminately. And I really don't want to either&#x2014;but perhaps I do want to experience it vicariously or to understand it through observation. I'd like to believe that it's really just a implicit manifestation of an interest in psychology rather than a subterranean desire to do those other things. <a href="http://www.capitalism.net/E_Packer/1-931089-12-4.pdf" title="PDF excerpt of Edith Packer's article entitled 'The Art of Introspection'">Introspectively</a>, I think the former is the reason because I bought a number of psychology and psychology-related books at the <a href="http://bbrown.info/2003/02/09/book-dealing-2.aspx">VNSA book sale</a> last Sunday.
</p>
<p>
Definitely something to keep an eye on, though.

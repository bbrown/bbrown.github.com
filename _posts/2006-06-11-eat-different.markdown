<a href="http://www.angryman.ca/monkey.html">Someone else</a> has had <a href="/2003/08/14/free-idea-2.aspx">my same desire</a> to be free of mealtime variety. Monkey chow, that was the missing link! Sadly, the "experiment" has been rather glib, resorting to the obvious "you are what you eat" cheap jokes. My original sentiment was serious: I would love to see a cheap food source developed that was nutritionally complete and available in huge quantities. I guess I'll just have to keep waiting. {<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/06/07/man_lives_on_monkey_.html">via</a>}

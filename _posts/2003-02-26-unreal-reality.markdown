<br />From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"><cite>The New York Times</cite></a>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/24/business/24REAL.html">"Networks Plan Flood of  Reality Shows for Summer"</a><br /><br /><blockquote><br />The four big networks are preparing to unleash at least <strong>two dozen</strong> reality shows from June to September, dwarfing the number currently on their schedules and more than doubling the number they broadcast last summer. [emphasis mine]<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I can understand the appeal of reality shows to the networks, and I guess I can understand the voyeuristic appeal to the American public, but isn't this a pretty dicey proposition for the networks? I've heard plenty of mumured disgust at the spate of reality shows&#x2014;I've <a href="2003_02_09_diamonds.cfm#88944814">murmured</a> myself&#x2014;and it seems like this phenomenon was a refreshing breath of air from the tired, repetitive formula show. Of course, formula is what the media does best so they're naturally looking to formula-ize the reality TV show. Makes you wonder what'll come after this? Perhaps scripted sitcoms?<br /><br /><br />

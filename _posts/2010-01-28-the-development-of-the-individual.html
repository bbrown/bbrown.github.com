<h2>A Comparison of Renaissance Views</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Renaissance represented, more so than nearly any other previous era in
European history<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a>, the pinnacle of man.
Other eras had viewed man as nothing more than a subject of God, a
profligate sinner, or a helpless robot. The Renaissance was a rekindling
of the classical view of man as an end in himself, a master of his own
destiny, a being of self-made soul. To be sure, there were exceptions to
this generalization, but they were of little import and were overshadowed
by the overall trend. The Renaissance humanists believed man to be
perfectible to a degree that, as I have said, few eras have.
</p>
<p>
The manner through which man could be perfected was the subject of many
essays, dialogues, and treatises. Most took the form of a letter
instructing a ruler or future ruler in the nature of a perfect ruler. From
this, the ruler (or other reader) could extract the author's version of
what it means to be perfect and how this is to be achieved. The two
selections that I have chosen as my specimens for analysis are Francesco
Barbaro's "On Wifely Duties" and Baldesar Castiglione's <cite>The Book of
the Courtier</cite>. I chose these two because they are widely-read and
representative of the culture of the Italian Renaissance. They present the
proper role and nature of the ideal wife and courtier. That these were
widely accepted is evinced by their popularity and longevity.
</p>
<p>
In each example, I will examine three areas: education, behavior, and
attitudes. These areas all are essential in painting the complete portrait
of the ideal&mdash;they are all part of the total program for perfection.
By education, I mean what steps the author would have the ideal character
take to acquire the knowledge necessary for him to be ideal. Each author
outlines a program, some more explicitly than others, for the exemplar to
follow. By behavior, I mean the model's outward manner&mdash;how he
interacts with others. Each author is excruciatingly specific on this
subject. Finally, I will delve into the attitudes of the ideal presented.
It is not necessarily so that the external behavior matches the internal
behavior. Again, some of the authors delve into this area more deeply than
others.
</p>
<p>
In so exploring these pieces and areas, I hope to gain a better
understanding of the dualistic nature of the Renaissance man and woman. On
the one hand, they attempted to refine themselves because they believed
that "man is a worthy being, capable of understanding the universe, and
that the universe is worthy of man's interest and study."<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a>
In other words, they displayed pride in man's nature. At the same time,
however, they upheld the Christian virtues of humility, renunciation, and
self-sacrifice&mdash;virtues which are antipodal to their outward
behavior. This contradiction, so endemic in Renaissance culture, would
prove to be the downfall of the Italian Renaissance&mdash;when the
so-called "crisis of confidence in the intellect"<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a>
reached its peak.
</p>
<h3>Francesco Barbaro's "On Wifely Duties"</h3>
<p>
Although the views expressed by Barbaro seem rather controversial today,
it is important that we examine his beliefs in the light of the
Renaissance&mdash;a time when feminism as we know it simply did not exist.
In fact, the paradigm put forth by Barbaro was utterly incontrovertible.
As Barbaro suggests, "the first principle [is] that she does not disagree
with her husband on any point."<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a>
</p>
<p>
The model wife has but two responsibilities: maintaining the household and
rearing the children. The end to which she performs these twin duties is
to free her husband of undue attention to family matters so that he may
pursue his role in public service. Her entire education and upbringing are
dedicated to these obligations. Barbaro does not go into great detail
about the educational program of the ideal wife, probably because the
focus of her duties is in the home.
</p>
<p>
Presumably, she must learn the proper methods of managing a household.
Barbaro analogizes the wife's role to that of the leaders of the bees. She
"supervise[s], receive[s], and preserve[s] whatever comes into their
[home]&hellip;." She trains the servants, "demonstrat[ing], indicat[ing],
and show[ing them] what they should be doing."<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a>
Barbaro invests in her the responsibility of maintaining order above all
else, since that is what "contributes greatly to the splendor, utility,
and pleasantness of their homes."<a href="#6" class="footnote">6</a> In
keeping her house in order, she is better serving her husband: her thrift
preserves his wealth and her diligence obviates his attention.
</p>
<p>
Her other role is that of mother. She must rear and educate the children,
in order that they will not squander the wealth that will be bequeathed to
them.<a href="#7" class="footnote">7</a> The duty falls on her shoulders
because Nature has "instilled in women an incredible love and affection
for their offspring."<a href="#8" class="footnote">8</a> Barbaro then lays
out an agenda for the children's education, which, presumably, he believes
would produce well-rounded Renaissance men and women. First, he says, they
should be taught of their duty to "Immortal God, their country, and their
parents&hellip;."<a href="#9" class="footnote">9</a>  Barbaro explains
that only those people who fear God, honor their country, and respect
their parents have any chance for greatness. The mother should also teach
the children moderation and temperance in all things: food, drink, speech,
passion, and laughter. Finally, the mother has the responsibility of
instructing her children in virtue, by example. "I [Barbaro] would have
mothers sharply criticized for displays of anger, greed, or sexual desire
in the presence of their offspring, for these vices weaken virtue."<a href="#10" class="footnote">10</a>
</p>
<p>
In the area of outward manner, Barbaro has much to say to the Renaissance
wife. First and foremost, the model wife must never disagree with her
husband, as the prior quote illustrates. As Barbaro said, "let the husband
give the orders, and let the wife carry them out with an even temper."<a href="#11" class="footnote">11</a>
This domestic tranquility is necessary in order for the husband to
concentrate on his public service.
</p>
<p>
He also thinks the wife should appear to reflect her husband's mood: "Let
wives strive so that their husbands will clearly perceive that they are
pensive or joyful according to the differing states of their husband's
fortunes."<a href="#12" class="footnote">12</a> This harkens back to
Barbaro's conception of the wife as handmaiden to her husband. If he is
troubled, she should appear pensive. If he is successful, she should
appear joyful. Further still, Barbaro advises, "If a husband, excited to
anger, should scold you more than your ears are accustomed to hear,
tolerate his wrath silently. But if he has been struck silent by a fit of
depression, you should address him with sweet and suitable words,
encourage, console, amuse, and humor him."<a href="#13" class="footnote">13</a>
Outwardly, then, the wife should function as an extension of the husband.
</p>
<p>
The final important component of a wife's conduct, in Barbaro's
conception, is discretion. A woman must know when to speak and when to
remain silent: "Loquacity cannot be sufficiently reproached in
women&hellip;nor can silence be sufficiently applauded."<a href="#14" class="footnote">14</a>
Further, "[w]hen addressed, wives should reply very modestly to familiar
friends and return their greetings, and they should very briefly treat
those matters that the time and place offer them."<a href="#15" class="footnote">15</a>
In Barbaro's schema, it seems that women should strive to appear totally
distant and aloof from all who are not their husband. This would also
support the hypothesis that Barbaro desired women to occupy a subordinate
position to men. For in praising women's so-called virtues, <em>viz.</em>,
silence, modesty, dependence, he is insuring their subordination.
</p>
<p>
In assessing the attitude or inner sentiments of the ideal wife as
presented by Barbaro, we cannot find explicit references. We must look at
the subtextual support. First, Barbaro supports and encourages repression.
"[W]ives must take great care that they do not entertain suspicions,
jealousy, or anger on account of what they hear with their ears."<a href="#16" class="footnote">16</a>
And, "[l]ust and unseemly desire are harmful to their dignity and to their
husbands&hellip;."<a href="#17" class="footnote">17</a> Also, the earlier
quotes from Barbaro warning wives never to disagree with their husbands
and to take their husband's anger silently, with no further mention.
Finally, "I would like wives to live with their husbands in such a way
that they can always be in agreement&hellip;."<a href="#18" class="footnote">18</a>
Barbaro, it seems, would have the model wife totally conceal and submerge
her desires, opinions, resentment, and even joy. She would do this so that
she may appear to her husband and others to be modest, chaste, and
serious.
</p>
<p>
Another characteristic of Barbaro's ideal wife's psyche is dependence.
This point has been emphasized already with respect to behavior, but it is
even more important in her inner world. "Let her be so close to him that
nothing seems good or pleasant to her without her husband."<a href="#19" class="footnote">19</a>
He also cites an example of a Spartan woman, taken from Plutarch, who
thinks it "best to follow the wishes of [her] husband if [she] wants to be
what [she] ought to be."<a href="#20" class="footnote">20</a> The
implication of these passages is not just that the ideal wife should
behave as her husband wishes, but that she should believe as he wishes. In
other words, she must subconsciously translate her opinions and desires
into "correct" thoughts.
</p>
<p>
The picture I have painted of Barbaro's "On Wifely Duties" is bleak. The
period in which it was written was not very conducive to the advancement
of women, so I cannot judge it by today's standards. Barbaro's vision of
the ideal wife is terribly unsettling to the modern woman. And rightly so,
for it fosters dependence and repression. To the husband, it seemed
perfect. A wife who is quiet, loving, and undemanding. Under the surface,
however, the story changes dramatically. More than likely, the average
Renaissance wife was a seething bundle of pent-up resentment and lust.
There is a subtextual awareness on the part of Barbaro of exactly this
sort of portrayal.
</p>
<p>
To sum, Barbaro believed that the wife should, foremost, obey her husband.
She must endeavor to match his expectations and the expectations of others
of how his wife should behave. Since her primary responsibilities are
maintenance of the household and rearing of the children, Barbaro would
have her education tailored to suit such needs, in addition to her
considerable moral education.
</p>
<h3>Baldesar Castiglione's Book of the Courtier</h3>
<p>
The <cite>Book of the Courtier</cite> stands in marked contrast to "On
Wifely Duties." For one thing, it covered a much more significant
topic&mdash;at least to the average Renaissance reader. It also went into
considerable detail about the education of its subject. It was also a
treatise whose ideal was never realized. Also, its subject matter is such
that modern readers cannot take umbrage at its direction.
</p>
<p>
Castiglione, in setting forth the program of education for the ideal
courtier, divides the subject into two forks: education of mind and of
body. On the latter, Castiglione is quite specific. Although the model
courtier's profession is arms, he must be very learned in letters. He must
know Latin and Greek. He must be well-versed in the poets, orators, and
historians of antiquity, as well as being able to write poetry and prose
in Italian. Castiglione supports the necessity of a liberal education to a
soldier by citing several antique military commanders who were quite fond
of literature, such as Alexander, C&aelig;sar, Scipio Africanus, and
Hannibal, among others.<a href="#21" class="footnote">21</a> He reasons
that a soldier familiar with the classical writings will be better able to
use his mind, a skill necessary in combat.
</p>
<p>
His perfect courtier's corporal training begins with extensive familiarity
with every kind of weapon, both on foot and on horseback, knowing the
advantages of each one. He must also be proficient in wrestling, since
wrestling "often accompanies the use of weapons on foot."<a href="#22" class="footnote">22</a>
Among the other sports he must excel at, such as horsemanship, swimming,
jumping, running, and tennis, Castiglione singles out hunting, both for
its "similarity to war" and its "suitab[ility] for a man at court."<a href="#23" class="footnote">23</a>
All of these elements in the overall regimen have a great effect in our
courtier's preparedness for combat.
</p>
<p>
The mien of the courtier is similarly developed. From the precept, "avoid
affectation,"<a href="#24" class="footnote">24</a> Castiglione moves to
the concept of <em>sprezzatura</em> or nonchalance. This principle (of
nonchalance) governs every action of the courtier. This gracefulness
"conceals all signs of artistry and makes whatever one does or says seem
effortless and unstudied."<a href="#25" class="footnote">25</a> It
connotates a certain sense of false modesty; a particular skill may have
taken a long time and much effort to acquire, but the courtier will
pretend that he had never encountered the need for the skill until the
present. Nonchalance extends into dress and appearance. Care must be taken
to appear as if one does care about such things. Castiglione recommends
simple clothing, virtually unadorned. As Castiglione said, "Art and
intense effort, once it is revealed, deprive everything of grace."<a href="#26" class="footnote">26</a>
</p>
<p>
Another important aspect of the model courtier is courtly love. According
to Castiglione, "love is nothing other than a certain desire to enjoy
beauty&hellip;."<a href="#27" class="footnote">27</a> Many people,
Castiglione says, mistake beauty for a bodily characteristic. He contends
that it is, instead, "divine goodness."<a href="#28" class="footnote">28</a>
Those who so confuse courtly love with physical love are "rebel[ling]
against reason" and experiencing the same "pleasures in love&hellip;that
unreasoning animals feel."<a href="#29" class="footnote">29</a> Thus,
Castiglione puts an unbreachable wedge between the pleasures of the mind
and the pleasures of the body.
</p>
<p>
Similar to nonchalance, a good courtier should always give the impression
that he is a great man, even though his words may downplay this and he
might feel otherwise in his mind. He should give "the impression of
avoiding self-praise while practicing it."<a href="#30" class="footnote">30</a>
This maintenance of reputation without visible effort is highly
characteristic of the Renaissance. In Barbaro's work, the wife is
constantly exhorted to remain composed and aloof so as to give observers
the correct impression of her virtue. In fact, one could argue that
Machiavelli's <cite>The Prince</cite> has this same idea for its theme.
But I digress.
</p>
<p>
What, then, should the inner state of the courtier be like? Castiglione
would have him be constantly calculative. For example, in his passage on
the provocation of laughter, Castiglione implores the courtier to
carefully weight the consequences of mockery. He says that the courtier
should not deride those who are too low of station, which might excite
compassion towards the individual being mocked and resentment towards the
courtier, nor those of too high a station, as they may use their power to
the courtier's detriment. Also, the courtier should be careful in speech:
"Let the courtier be eloquent when it meets his purpose&hellip;."<a href="#31" class="footnote">31</a>
Further, he must be "diffident and reserved rather than forward."<a href="#32" class="footnote">32</a>
This reticence in external manner belies the internal calculation, in much
the same way as the doctrine of nonchalance dictates.
</p>
<p>
Subtextually, we see much similarity to Barbaro's "On Wifely Duties." The
courtier is constantly working to make his manner appear spontaneous and
effortless. He attempts to garner esteem while explicitly denying the root
causes for such praise. The appearance masks the reality. Moreover, in
placing the locus of morality on others, Castiglione has made the courtier
dependent on other's judgment and approval.
</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
Herein lies the fundamental contradiction that doomed the Italian
Renaissance. By Aristotle's Law of Non-Contradiction, something cannot
simultaneously be both what it is and what it is not. Colloquially,
contradictions cannot exist in perpetuity. While implicitly upholding the
notion that man is an end in himself and perfectible, the Italian
Renaissance simultaneously and explicitly embraced the Christian doctrines
of man's body as smutty and degrading and man's nature as sinful. As the
saying goes, you cannot have your cake and eat it too. Something had to
give.
</p>
<p>
That something was reason. When their heretofore sovereign reason
indicated that a contradiction was in the works, the Italians were faced
with two options. Either they could reaffirm the dominance of reason and
eradicated the contradictions inherent in their belief systems or they
could banish reason altogether from the sphere of human activity. Since
they had been indoctrinated with Christianity for over one thousand years,
one could safely say that their cultural situation did not bode well for
reason. They banished reason to the realm of the body&mdash;traditionally,
science and mathematics&mdash;and upheld faith's supremacy in all things
moral.
</p>
<p>
The consequences were dramatic and far-reaching. The Italian Renaissance
wound down and the torch was passed to Northern Europe. The Italian
cultural situation deteriorated in a series of wars. The papacy's power
was diminished by the Lutheran Reformation. The focus of the Western
intellectual tradition shifted to Paris, London, and Amsterdam rather than
Venice, Florence, and Rome.
</p>
<p>
Castiglione and Barbaro were, however, still widely read after the fall of
the Italian Renaissance. It is a tribute to their skill that the <cite>Book
of the Courtier</cite> was still considered required reading for Northern
European courtiers and that the model wife remained much the same. These
two treatises have several similarities which I have mentioned. They both
create ideal persons who are, at once, proud of their status and skill and
required to qualify, marginalize, and downplay this same status and skill.
They both create a rift between appearance and reality, mind and body,
outer and inner. The only real difference is found in the nature of their
subject matter. Barbaro really cannot say much, since the woman's role is
as handmaiden to her husband. Castiglione has the freedom and opportunity
to really create a Renaissance man.

<br />Does <a href="http://radiocomments.userland.com/comments?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.docuverse.com%2Fblog%2Fdonpark%2F2003%2F07%2F11.html%23a703&amp;p=703&amp;u=112479">this</a> seem like I'm flaming <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2003/07/11.html#a703">Don</a>? I'm starting to think so.<br /><br />If so, then I declare this my first ever Web-based flame! (NOTE: I've flamed a lot when I was a kid on <acronym title="Bulletin Board System">BBS</acronym>s, but never on the Web or Usenet.) Hmm, I'm not sure I like it so much. On the other hand, this is nothing that I wouldn't say in public to his face. It's an old-fashioned slippery slope argument, possibly even satire&#x2014;I can't decide which.<br /><br /><br />

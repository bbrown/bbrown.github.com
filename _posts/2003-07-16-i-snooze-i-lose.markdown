<br />157 pages into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596004656/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Head First Java</cite></a> with the full intention of reviewing it for <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> and <a href="http://honestpuck.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi">some guy</a> <a href="http://honestpuck.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi">beats me</a> to it. PISSER! Why couldn't I speed through it for the review instead of methodically reading it!<br /><br />I'll definitely post a review here when I'm done. For now, let me just say that <a href="http://www.headfirstjava.com/">it</a> seems like a great Java introduction.<br /><br /><br />

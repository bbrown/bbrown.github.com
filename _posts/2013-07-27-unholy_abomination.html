This commercial (and the whole series of them) are very disturbing to me. Not only do the anthropomorphized cereal squares eat each other, they somehow have bizarrely-long tongues. These tongues are <em>several times longer</em> than their bodies. And, lacking arms or hands, they use them for a variety of non-traditional tongue purposes.

So gross!

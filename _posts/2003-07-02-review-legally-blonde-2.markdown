<br />I saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JM53/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Legally Blonde 2</cite></a> last night with my wife and a friend.<br /><br />[UPDATE: I had a full review ready to post when OmniWeb 4.5b2 crashed. I tried everything to recover it, but couldn't. I don't have the inclination right now to go through that again, so you don't get the pleasure of my wit. I'll sum, though: Forgettable. Bob Newhart as <em>deus ex machina</em> makes me wish he was still making television shows. Sorry, maybe I'll feel like it sometime. It was a really good review. Then the computer just went *beep* *beep* *beep* and it was gone.]<br /><br /><br />

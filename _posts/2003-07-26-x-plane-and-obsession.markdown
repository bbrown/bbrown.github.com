<br />I read an <a href="http://www.popsci.com/popsci/aviation/article/0,12543,463052,00.html">article</a> about Austin Meyer's and his beloved flight simulator <a href="http://www.x-plane.com/">X-Plane</a> in this month's <a href="http://www.popsci.com/"><cite>Popular Science</cite></a> (also <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/23/1837201&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=127&amp;tid=186&amp;tid=206">discussed</a> over at Slashdot) yesterday. At first, I was amazed and delighted about the story of the underdog versus the colossal Microsoft.<br /><br />However, I quickly realized that Meyer's passion had become an obsession.<br /><br />I had a lengthy, interesting essay ready to post about the perils of obsession using examples like oyster shucking and dog shows. I got to the point where I had integrated the data points and was drawing a conclusion when I went to quit <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnidictionary/">OmniDictionary</a>&#x2014;I was looking up "dissemble" to verify its meaning&#x2014;and quit <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a> instead. Barnacles!<br /><br />The point I was trying to make is that obsession leads to neglect of important areas of your life. It can be as simple as feeling some compunction to post a daily message in your blog and as destructive as needing to work constantly. It's easy to get lost in an obsession and it is hard to shake once identified.<br /><br />Where does interest end and obsession begin? That's a question I wrestle with frequently. I check my logs several times throughout the day. I like to see what sort of referrers I'm getting, what my page requests for the day are, how this month stacks up to previous months. Is this obsession? I don't know. I think about it frequently though I'm not anxious if I go a day or two without doing it. If it is obsession, what is to be done? It doesn't seem to be harmful and I've gotten it down to a simple FTP session followed by a quick running of a shell script for processing.<br /><br />Reviewing my life, I see many other computer-related obsessions. The checking of email dozens of times a day, the visiting of the same sites every day, the keeping up with RSS subscriptions numbering nearly 150. Much of it seems to <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/24/2355245&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=146&amp;tid=99">mask as procrastination</a>, but the length of time I've been doing it and the fact that I keep up the routine even when nothing is impending suggests that the little-o might be at work here.<br /><br />On the other hand, reviewing some of the details of <a href="http://www.capitalism.net/E_Packer/1-931089-16-7.pdf">obsession</a> suggests that I may be in error in my evaluation since I don't feel out of control and it doesn't appear to be a defense mechanism.<br /><br />I don't know. Maybe I should try to limit these activities by sheer force of will to see if I can do it successfully without anxiety. Wouldn't that prove that it wasn't obsession?<br /><br />[UPDATE (7/28/03): This post was actually composed at nearly midnight on Sunday. It's probably much more revealing than I would prefer, so take from it what you will. The lost version was much less personal.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (4/14/05): Found an <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000706.php">interesting post</a> about the wonders of X-Plane.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />Funny situation: <a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/">Ask Yahoo!</a> answers a <a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20030729.html">question about the Volkswagen Thing</a> and provides some helpful links and information about the Jeep-like car whose actual name is Thing.<br /><br />One of the sites the answer links to is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/vwtyp181/index.htm">VW 181 Facts and Figures</a>, a page about the military precursor to the Thing that is hosted on GeoCities (a Yahoo property). Clicking on the link shows an error message stating that the Web site has "exceeded its allocated data transfer." You'd think that Yahoo would have some means to ease restrictions when it sends a lot of traffic that way.<br /><br /><br />

<p>
In a better world, Senator Charles Schumer's <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/07/15/us_sen_schumer_writes_letter_to_apple_ceo_over_iphone_4_antenna.html">open letter</a> to Steve Jobs would receive one of Jobs' <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=steve+jobs+replies">famous</a> curt responses like:
</p>
<blockquote>"Mind your own business. We'll handle this. Stay tuned."</blockquote>
<p>
My response to such an affront would be very different and much less polite.

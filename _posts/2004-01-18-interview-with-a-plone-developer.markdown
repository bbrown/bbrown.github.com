<br />O'Reilly conducted a brief <a href="http://osdir.com/Article199.phtml">interview with the Plone developers</a> after their <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3957">Comdex win</a> as one of the five best open-source software programs. Plone, for those of you who are new to the Bill Brown Information Center (and its blog), is the future <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> of the BBIC&#x2014;whenever I get some time to work on it.<br /><br /><br />

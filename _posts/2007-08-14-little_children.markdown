<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000N3SU92/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Little Children</cite></a> is one of those movies where you spend most of the time expecting that you're going to hate it at the end so you don't really invest much of yourself into it. But in the end, you like it and wish you had appreciated it earlier. This movie had all the makings of yet another suburban-housewife-jumping-in-the-sack-and-ruining-her-marriage flick and yet it didn't fall for that formula. In the end, it's a tale of redemption and volition. And I loved it!

I should begin by commenting about how wonderfully made the movie was. The omniscient, anthropologistic narrator was used just as much as necessary but no more than that&#x2014;I have certainly seen my fair share of ham-handed voiceovers.

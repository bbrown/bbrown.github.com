<br /><a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/">Jeffrey Veen</a> has a great entry about <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000483.html">making better presentations</a> with a bunch of great comments left by visitors. I would second his suggestions and add that people should read Weissman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130464139/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Presenting to Win</cite></a> as well. I especially like his suggestion about using PowerPoint unconventionally. People definitely would notice that.<br /><br /><br />

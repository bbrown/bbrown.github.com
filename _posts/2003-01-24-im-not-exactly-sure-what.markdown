<br />I'm not exactly sure what to make of <a href="http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/014/science/Zap_+.shtml" title="Supermagnets? How do they find people willing to undergo testing?">this article</a>. I really need to read more about neuroscience.<br /><br />Favorite quote, about early testing of the device on the researchers themselves: "No one knew if we were going to be the next one to have a seizure, or if 12 years of medical residency would suddenly get blown away."<br /><br /><br />

<br />Throw away your <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/13/have_you_seen_my_website.html">milk cartons</a>, John Robb is <a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/">back</a>. The erstwhile CEO of UserLand still isn't talking about the strange circumstances of his displacement, but I imagine that there's enough bad blood there that he'll get to it eventually.<br /><br /><br />

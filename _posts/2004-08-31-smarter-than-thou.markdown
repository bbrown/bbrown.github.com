<br />Marc Hedlund has an excellent <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5514">essay</a> on the evils of Microsoft Word in particular and software that second-guesses the user in general. Anyone who develops software or web applications would be well advised to read this and commit to heeding its advice.<br /><br />[UPDATE: On further thought, it comes down to a precarious balance between this and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789723107/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Don't Make Me Think</cite></a>. How much intelligence is too much? That's the fine line.]<br /><br /><br />

<h2>What to Do About Eastern Europe</h2>
<p>
The nations of Eastern Europe finally have the opportunity to experience
what Americans have long taken for granted: what it is to be free. Since
the days when the Mongolian Khans ruled the region, the Slavic peoples
have been oppressed. Unfortunately, due to this tradition of oppression,
they are now at a loss as to how to democratize their former Communist
governments and socialist economies that have so utterly failed them. We
owe it to them, as their freedom loving brethren, to impart whatever
knowledge we have garnered from our 215 years of experience in democracy.
However, with this obligation comes a quandary: What should we share with
them that would make their efforts more successful? Do we lead them
towards the path of democratic "democratic big government," with its
corollary risk of welfare statism? Or would the practices of the Reagan
Administration, or "Reaganomics," perhaps be a better choice? If Eastern
Europe's experiment with freedom is be long lasting, its governments must
reject everything from the twentieth century of world (and more
specifically, American) history. They must adopt the plan of action
conceived of by the delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Founding Fathers advocated a limited
government that was pledged to protect the liberty of its citizens.
However, they never enacted the limited government to the extent that was
necessary and fell prey to the seductive power that is inherent in any
government. Thus, they rejected the only means to their end, total
liberty. If the former Communists can create a truly limited government,
there is the potentiality that they could surpass the industrialized
nations in prosperity.

A limited government occurs when a government understands the proper role
of the law in society and confines itself to that role. According to
Bastiat, a French liberal during the 1848 socialist revolutions, "&hellip;
<em>the purpose of the law is to prevent injustice from reigning.</em>"
In order to achieve that goal, the citizens relinquish their rights to the
use of force to the government. However, the government can only utilize
that force when a citizen's unalienable rights&mdash;life, liberty, and
property&mdash;are being infringed upon by a foreign or domestic source.
The government must not discriminate when it comes to applying justice;
there can be no special protection nor undue persecution of any minority.
To check this great power, the government is restricted by a written
constitution that specifically delineates the powers and restrictions of
the government. Since this constitution is a compact between the
government and the people, if the people feel that the government is
abusing its privilege of force or deviating from the constitution, that
government can be declared illegal and the compact void. To summarize, a
limited government is one that administers justice and protects its
citizens from any harm or threat of harm. It does nothing more and nothing
less. In the words of Henry David Thoreau, famed American
transcendentalist, "That government is best which governs least."

The American tradition of liberalism permeates every era of American
history to some extent. In the Colonial Era, Americans rallied against the
auspices of tyranny under King George III and demanded their rights as
Englishmen. They vehemently asserted their rights to self-government. In
fact, a popular slogan, "No taxation without representation," affords a
good demonstration of Colonial resentment of British rule. The Stamp Act
Congress showed that the Americans were willing to unify against the
outrageous Stamp Act. During the American Revolution, liberalism was at
the forefront. The Declaration of Independence, the foundation upon which
American government rests, states that "All men are created equal [and]
endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights." This is
congruent with the definition of limited government given earlier. This is
exactly what the American Revolutionaries set up, albeit a severly limited
one. The Articles of Confederation created an emasculated central
government that was merely a figurehead in a confederation of sovereign
states. It could not wage war, it could hardly pass laws, and it could not
force any state to comply with its wishes. Luckily, the Founding Fathers
of 1787 learned from their earlier mistakes. When they set out to create a
new government at the Constitutional Convention, most of the delegates
were firm believers in the ideas of the Enlightenment and had read the
works of John Locke and Thomas Hobbes. This created a general consensus
which allowed the delegates to concentrate on the specifics without having
to bicker about the basic concepts. The result was the greatest written
constitution ever created. It defined three branches of government, each
of which had separate and distinct powers. They established a system of
checks and balances which prevented any one branch from becoming dominant.
They also specified the powers of the federal government versus the powers
of the state governments, another check. Article 1, Section 8 of the
Constitution provides a list of eight powers which the federal government
is forbidden to exercise. In the very next section, it defines what powers
are denied to the states. Then, in 1791, the Bill of Rights were amended
to the Constitution. They enumerate the basic civil liberties of American
citizens upon which the government absolutely cannot tread and must secure
at all costs. In addition, they made the whole government (federal and
state) directly responsible to the people of the United States through
frequent elections. As Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of
Independence and U.S. President, once said,  "the republican is the only
form of government which is not eternally at open or secret war with the
rights of mankind."
</p>

The Founding Fathers had made it impossible for the government to trample
on the people's civil liberties and escape unscathed. Or so they thought.
The Republic continued, ideologically unabated, until the post-Civil War
era. This was the time of the founding of the Departments of Interior and
Agriculture and the enacting of the anti-trust legislation. These were the
first of many Cabinet-level departments that were wholly without
Constitutional support. If we go back to the views of the Founding Fathers
at the time of the Constitutional Convention, we will find that these
Departments are similarly unsupported and most probably condemned. The
Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890 signaled the end of America's ideal of
constitutionally limited government, for its provisions gave the
Department of Justice almost unchecked power in bringing lawsuits against
any business it so chose. The Department of Justice could sentence that
business to shut down, sell its subsidiaries, or divest of its
subsidiaries, for business practices that may not have been illegal when
they were committed. This is ex post facto law, which was specifically
declared <em>verboten</em>  in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution.
Thus began the downhill slide into welfare statism. The next step on this
downward path was the Great Depression and Franklin Roosevelt's
Depression-relief plan, termed "The New Deal." President Roosevelt set up
make-work programs, Social Security, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, and even pro-labor governmental organizations. These programs
may have been necessary in light of the incredible government-caused
Great Depression, but they should have immediately been repealed after the
Depression was over. Instead, they remained and today are bigger than
anything Franklin Roosevelt had envisioned. They were completely contrary
to every ideal the Founding Fathers ever espoused. This trend of "big
government" represented a total about face from the preference for
"limited government" favored by the politicians of the early Republic. In
fact, there is a remarkable similarity between the common complaints about
America's government today and the grievances leveled by Thomas Jefferson
at King George III. Of course, the scale of tyranny by King George III
pales in comparison to that of the modern American welfare state.

How can the nations of Eastern Europe implement a limited government and
benefit from our experience? The first step is to create a constitution
that is modeled on the Constitution of the United States. Once they have 
done so, they must adhere to this supreme law of the land. A government is
either absolutely committed to liberty or it is authoritarian; there is no
middle ground. There is no such thing as "just a little infringement on
civil liberties." Next, they must build a efficacious framework for the
capitalist businesses. This means creating a pure gold standard,
establishing standards of weights and measures, creating an institution to
grant and uphold patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and providing
highways for interstate transportation. It also implies that the
government is dedicated to ensuring freedom of private property, contract,
and competition. Once all this has been done, the only thing the
government must do is mete out justice and maintain an otherwise
<em>laissez-faire</em>  attitude towards society. If the nations of
Eastern Europe can achieve this&mdash;a remarkable achievement that has
eluded all Western nations&mdash;there is no telling how much material and
spiritual prosperity will result. They will have the world's only truly
free people and, potentially, the most prosperous economy ever.

The philosopher Santayana once said, "Those who do not remember the past
are condemned to relive it." We must bear in mind Santayana's words, for
America has not learned from her past. We are stuck in the quagmire of
welfare statism with no freedom in sight. Therefore, we must instruct the
intelligentsia of Eastern Europe in the ways of our elders with the hopes
that one day we will be able to emulate them as they will have emulated
us. Until that time comes, I will mourn for America.

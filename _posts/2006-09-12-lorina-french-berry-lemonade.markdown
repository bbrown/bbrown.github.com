<p>I have a thing for lemonades. I'm also, for reasons that I can't seem to introspect successfully, a Francophile. Oh, and I adore berry-flavored drinks. So this one has a lot going for it before I've even opened the bottle. The first sips are delightful: no aftertaste, no filminess in my mouth, and the flavor is tasty. I don't really get the lemonade aspect, but I'll trust Lorina that they're not lying. The "sparkling" aspect of the lemonade is a little distracting&#x2014;enough that I can't give it five stars. (Sidenote: one of the ingredients is "grape skin extract." What the heck is that!?)

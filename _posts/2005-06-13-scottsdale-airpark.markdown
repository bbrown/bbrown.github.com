<br />I've spent a lot of time in the last month wandering around the "park" aspects of the Scottsdale Airpark but I hadn't at all checked out the "air" parts.<br /><br />So today I crossed Hayden and wandered down Acoma knowing that I'd eventually hit runway. I found a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=33.617683,-111.914762&amp;spn=0.005272,0.009828&amp;hl=en">shady spot</a> with some very lush grass and parked my hiney down to read and take in airplanes. (The airport near my home, <a href="http://phoenix.gov/AVIATION/deervalley/">Deer Valley Airport</a>, has a better selection of flights but absolutely no comparable roadside viewing areas.) It was next to (and probably part of) a closed-down <a href="http://www.hawkscorvettesandclassics.com/">Corvette showroom</a> that had an interesting parking lot with arbors for covered parking and a recessed landscaping feature that looked a little like a Zen garden. (Perhaps they spent all their money on the site and not enough on the business.)<br /><br />Nothing particularly interesting to report: saw a jet take off and another land; saw tons of what I presume to be training planes; realized that my vantage point was largely obscured by a chain-link fence and was too far down the runway for watching takeoffs and landings up close.<br /><br /><br />

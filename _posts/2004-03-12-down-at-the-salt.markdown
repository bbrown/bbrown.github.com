<br />Today I spent my lunch hour walking around the Salt River riverbed near the intersection of the Loop 202 and SR-143 and I had an incredible time.<br /><br />First, the area is rich in history&#x2014;especially for someone who can imagine <a href="http://www.ci.phoenix.az.us/PARKS/pueblo.html">Hohokam</a> digging out canals to irrigate their lands near <a href="/values/places/papagopark.cfm">Papago Park</a>. Or ex-Confederate <a href="http://southwest.library.arizona.edu/hav2/body.1_div.12.html">Jack Swilling</a> spotting these ditches and envisioning a farming community in the middle of a seemingly-inhospitable desert. It sounds strange, but I can vividly feel the history as I walk around.<br /><br />Second, I found some semblance of the Salt River far in the bottom of the riverbed. It was wide enough that I couldn't jump it, so I had to hop across on rocks. I didn't even realize it was there until I came right up to it; you certainly can't see it from the road. Related to that, I saw at least half a dozen jackrabbits sprinting away from my movement. They're beautiful, graceful animals.<br /><br />Finally, I came across some truly amazing graffiti in a huge storm drain that passes underneath the Loop 202. By truly amazing, I mean photorealistic and definitely arty. Unfortunately, I didn't have my camera so you'll have to wait for pictures.<br /><br />It was a great little trip that was unfortunately shortened by lots of aimless wandering. Future journeys won't lack the focus that this trip had.<br /><br /><br />

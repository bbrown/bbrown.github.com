<br />Halfway through my sample chapter (yeah!) so I can't do much more right now than link to this article on <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2003/07/31/extremeprogramming.html">five lessons from extreme programming</a>. I really like the ideas behind extreme programming and my boss's boss expressed an interest in it, so I'd like to explore it more. Will do it later. Promise.<br /><br /><br />

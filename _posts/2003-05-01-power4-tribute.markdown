<br />The most recent issue of <a href="http://www.eweek.com/">eWeek</a> features an <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1046289,00.asp">analysis/paean</a> to <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>'s <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/pseries/hardware/whitepapers/power4.html" title="You needn't click on this unless you are a CPU designer, I think.">Power4 chip</a>. The quote that lept off the page and floored me was the following:<br /><br /><blockquote>The two CPU cores on a single Power4 chip share more than 100GB per second of bandwidth to their shared L2 cache and more than 55GB per second to memory. Personally, I overflow on numbers that big; perhaps, like me, you'll find it easier to think of 55GB as 26 hours of DVD video&#x2014;a stupefying amount of data. And the IBM eServer p655 series, shipped late last year, can hold four- and eight-processor blocks that stack up to 128 Power4 processors per frame.</blockquote><br /><br />Okay, so the Power4 chip is mighty in its power and those new p655 servers must be the bomb. What's that got to do with me or you? Well, there are <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2003/03/20030310042739.shtml">longstanding</a> (and credible) <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2003/02/20030227065458.shtml" title="2.5GHz, 64-bit. Homina, homina, homina.">rumors</a> that <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> is going to go with the <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/wankerdesk/3q02/powerpc.html">PowerPC 970</a>&#x2014;a Power4-derived CPU&#x2014;as its G5-series processor. If that happens, you can finally expect some serious firepower under the hood of your Mac.<br /><br /><br />

<br />Doesn't this <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/39/32540.html">trademark conflict</a> seem odd? Rendezvous is a French word for meeting that has been completely integrated into English. How can it properly be trademarked? <a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-876576.html">Windows can't</a>, so how is this any different?<br /><br />Moreover, it sounds like <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> has successfully trademarked the name. How could the <acronym title="United States Patent and Trademark Office">USPTO</acronym> allow Apple to register the trademark if another company actually owned it? I guess I just don't understand.<br /><br /><br />

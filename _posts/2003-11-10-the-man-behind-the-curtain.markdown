<br />I just finished watching the <a href="http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/385/385406p1.html">episode</a> of <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/"><cite>Inside the Actor's Studio</cite></a> featuring the cast of <a href="http://www.snpp.com/"><cite>The Simpsons</cite></a>. It was incredible to see the actors who voice the various characters. I've seen them all in different roles over the years, so I knew exactly who did what. But there's something eerie and disconcerting about seeing Nancy Cartwright doing Bart Simpson and Nelson Muntz. Even <a href="/values/people/sandibrown.cfm">Sandi</a> agreed.<br /><br /><br />

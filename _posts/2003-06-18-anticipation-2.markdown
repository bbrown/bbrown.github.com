<br />The latest news from <a href="http://www.macosrumors.com/" title="Sorry, no permalinks. It's the one from June 18th">Mac OS Rumors</a>&#x2014;did I just say news regarding that site? Reminds me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000IQBW/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>So I Married an Axe Murderer</cite></a>&#x2014;is simply amazing. A dual-processor G5 PowerBook 17"? I'm not sure I should attend the Keynote at the Apple Store: I may faint and start a Mac-head domino chain reaction. Now <strong>that</strong> would be perfect successor to Thor, my aging (hah! he's two years old!) PowerBook G4.<br /><br /><br />

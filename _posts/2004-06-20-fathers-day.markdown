<br />So today was my first Father's Day and it was a blast. Unfortunately, Kimberly woke me up at 5 a.m. and so it started a bit earlier than I would have liked. The family bought me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001Z3IPS/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>The Simpsons</cite> Season 4 DVD</a> and I watched four or five episodes immediately. It's a great season: it features <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/9F10.html">"Marge vs. the Monorail</a>&#x2014;one of the best episodes ever, <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/8F18.html">"A Streetcar Named Marge"</a>&#x2014;which had the Ayn Rand School for Tots in it, <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/9F18.html">"Whacking Day"</a> (favorite line: "I've got a hankering for some spankering."), and <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/9F07.html">"Mr. Plow"</a>.<br /><br />We spent the rest of the day in our traditional holiday fashion of shuttling between my family and Sandi's family. That meant we left the house at about 10:30 a.m. and returned by 6:20 p.m. That disrupted The Girls' schedule, to put it mildly.<br /><br />Not too eventful, but spending it with the people who mean the most to you makes it memorable.<br /><br /><br />

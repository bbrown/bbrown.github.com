Many have asked me who I'm voting for this November. My stock answer is "I'm voting against Obama." We all laugh and then I get to disparage McCain while touching on my fear of the government expansion that Obama is seeking. Sometimes I get assent about that growth but many other times I get a puzzled look or even, puzzlingly to me, a disagreement that he's going to expand the federal government in a big way.

This <cite>Investor's Business Daily</cite> <a href="http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=307665441951152">editorial</a> does a decent job of covering the salient planks of Obama's platform that should give pause to all freedom-loving Americans. Really though, a good reading of his <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/issues/">campaign's policy issues sections</a> ought to make you an anti-Obama voter too.

I could go through his platform plank by plank, but I'm not sure anyone reading this would be interested. Leave a comment if you would be&#x2026;

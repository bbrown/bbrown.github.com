<br /><a href="http://arnoldkling.com/">Arnold Kling</a> has responded to <a href="">Doc Searls's</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/">David Weinberger's</a> essay <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/">"World of Ends"</a> in his <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/">TechCentralStation</a> article <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/techwrapper.jsp?PID=1051-250&amp;CID=1051-031303B">"Geeks and Suits."</a><br /><br />I first encountered Kling in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204684/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/"><cite>Under the Radar</cite></a> and his <a href="http://www.corante.com/bottomline/">Corante</a> blog <a href="http://www.corante.com/bottomline/">"The Bottom Line"</a> before moving on to his more economically-oriented <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/">EconLog</a>.<br /><br />"World of Ends" is a very <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204315/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Cluetrain</cite></a>-like manifesto&#x2014;not surprising given that its two authors were <a href="http://www.searls.com/cluetrain/" title="Free online version">Cluetrain</a> authors as well&#x2014;but addresses itself to a different group of people. They say that it's supposed to be directed to executives, but I'm not sure that they'd get the inspired wisdom it's suposed to deliver. [NOTE: inspired wisdom in the last sentence is supposed to be derogatory and sarcastic. If only there was markup for that.]<br /><br />Kling does an excellent job of attacking their essay's salient deficiencies. I concur with him. I don't think I really have anything substantial to add to his criticism, though I think he's a mite generous in leveling it.<br /><br /><br />

<br />David Crawford's <a href="http://turbulence.org/studios/crawford/">Stop Motion Studies</a> are interesting photographic compositions, as long as you don't read the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/English/ENGL2012Klages/pomo.html" title="A postmodernist defines postmodernism. Don't worry, it's not meant to be understood.">pomo</a> captions he's attached to make them sound significant in addition to interesting:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />The <cite>Stop Motion Studies</cite> extend my long standing interest in narrative and, in particular, look at the subway as a stage upon which social dynamics and individual behavior are increasingly mediated by digital technology. As one of the most vibrant and egalitarian networks in our cities, subways bring people from a wide range of social and cultural backgrounds into close contact with each other. This process plays a significant role in shaping both the character of a city as well as our individual identities. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />Please also note the lack of superlative qualifiers in the first sentence and the failure to use a more powerful adjective than "interesting." The pictures are interesting, though completely devoid of meaning.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Crawford "has received numerous grants, honors, and awards from organizations including the National Endowment for the Arts and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art." The quote above was probably taken directly from his grant proposal.<br /><br /><br />

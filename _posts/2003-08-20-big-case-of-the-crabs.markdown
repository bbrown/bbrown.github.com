<br />Ooohhhh, I had all-you-can-eat Alaskan snow crab at Red Lobster tonight. I thought I overdid it, having four plates at &#xBD; pound each plate. Our waitress let me know that my performance was, in fact, quite mediocre&#x2014;easily bested by the gentleman who ate 20 plates of the crab and had room for desert. I didn't ask about his girth, but it must have been considerable.<br /><br />My two pounds of crab was plenty. Around the last three legs, I wasn't exactly stuffed but I <em>was</em> sick of the taste of crab. Oh, and sick of removing the crab shell to get to the succulent meat. It was fun at first, but it got old <strong>real</strong> quick.<br /><br /><br />

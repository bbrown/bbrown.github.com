<p>If you're more interested in the subject of James J. Hill after reading <a href="http://bbrown.info/2008/10/15/the-panic-of-1873-and-the-current-crisis.aspx">my mention of him</a>, I would encourage you to read this series of blog entries that does a capable job of an overview:</p><ol><li><a href="http://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=539">James J. Hill, Entrepreneur</a></li><li><a href="http://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=541">James J. Hill, Empire Builder</a></li><li><a href="http://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=542">James J. Hill, Conservationist</a></li><li><a href="http://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=543">James J. Hill's Legacy</a></li></ol><p>In the "Conservationist" entry, I cannot believe that the author left out the Great Northern Railway's pivotal role in the development and promotion of what would later become the Glacier National Park. It could have served as an excellent, private model in lieu of the National Park Service.</p><p>[UPDATE (10/17/2008): Added "Legacy" link.]</p>

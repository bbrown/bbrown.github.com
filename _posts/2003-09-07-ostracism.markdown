<br />Someone recently downloaded 721 pages from my site. I ask you, "Why the hell would you want to download all that?" I really can't think of any good reason&#x2014;even Google only downloads that much in about two weeks. The person who is probably wanting to study the Bill Brown Information Center in considerable detail offline has inspired me to create a banishment system for the Center. It's really simple: it just intercepts your every request and sends you to the <a href="/banned.cfm">ostracism page</a>.<br /><br />The person who did the stupid sucking won't be reading this, though, because he's the first one in the banned structure. Congratulations!<br /><br />[NOTE: The reason such a significant download is bannable is because it seriously skews my statistics and there's really no good reason to download my content in my entirety. Would I ban you if you did it gradually and over time? Probably not. What's my threshold? I'll never tell.]<br /><br /><br />

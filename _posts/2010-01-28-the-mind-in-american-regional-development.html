In the decades prior to the War between the States, the North and the
South took very different paths. The North, with a long tradition of
merchants and manufacturing, industrialized. The South, long the
storehouse and producer of the nation's food supply, did not. Also by this
time, most of the North had abolished slavery and involuntary servitude
outright and emancipated the former slaves. The South had not. Are these
two events related? Is there any connection between industrialization and
slavery? Between slavery and stagnation? Yes! The North industrialized
precisely because it regarded the institution of slavery as immoral. If it
had retained the right of one person to hold another in bondage, it would
not have industrialized as successfully as it did. Similarly, the South
never achieved prosperity because of its promotion of slavery. The
institution of slavery presupposes assent to three premises: that men can
be a means to an end, that the government grants you individual rights and
can take them away at will, and that man's mind is irrelevant. The first
two premises follow from the last one, but they are all too significant to
be left untouched. The South <em>qua</em> slaveholding region accepted
these three premises and never was able to industrialize to the extent the
North did.
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand the nature of production before we can
examine the economic systems of the two regions of the United States
generally and the slave system of the South, in particular. What is
production? It is the application of man's mind to man's need to survive.
Man's survival is not guaranteed; one must eke out one's existence against
the elements. Animals do not have this problem since they operate on
instinct. When their stomachs growl, their instincts tell them what is and
is not food. When man is hungry, there is no similar instinctual
mechanism. He must first discern what the sensation means. Then he must
understand what would satisfy that sensation. Finally, he must devise a
plan to acquire food (or, in modern society, make it) to satisfy it. On
the simple level of survival, the importance of thought is readily
self-evident. As societies evolve into more complex interrelationships,
the role of thought&mdash;and the mind&mdash;becomes more and more
important, but less and less obvious. Typically, first, you have an
inventor who creates something where a void had existed previously. For
example, in 1814, a Englishman named George Stephenson invented the modern
railroad locomotive. At this point, the role of the mind is unmistakable.
This product would never have existed without the ingenuity of
Stephenson's mind. Later, entrepreneurs saw the promise of the locomotive.
They established companies to utilize Stephenson's invention to solve the
problem of transportation. They exchanged a passenger's or shipper's fare
for conveyance. Thus, the entrepreneurs were able to survive and flourish
through the use of their mind. The passengers were able to survive and
flourish through the use of their's, since they had used their minds to
earn the wages to pay for their fare. In short, at every stage of the
economy, production depends on mental effort. But, since survival is not
automatic, production is not either. It depends on the ability of the mind
to gather observations, develop hypotheses, and act on its thoughts. Thus,
there are requirements for the successful use of reason, namely that the
mind must be free. Any element of force negates the mind. For example,
when a mugger points a gun at you and insists that you give him your
money, the mind must evade the knowledge that it is your money and that he
has no right to it. Similarly, on a much grander scale, if the government
tells you that you must pay them income taxes, your mind has to ignore the
facts of reality; <em>viz.</em>, the government has not earned the right
to your money and that to say otherwise is to support robbery.
</p>
<p>
The political implication of this important principle is individual
rights. If man survives and flourishes through the use of his mind, then
the proper function of government is to insure that conditions are such
that the mind remains uninhibited. The government must protect the rights
of life, liberty, and property because they represent the metaphysical
requirements of man's mind. Man's mind requires that man be able to pursue
survival, that is, life. Man's mind requires that he be able to be free to
act on whatever his reason dictates so long as it does not involve the
coercion of others, that is, he must be at liberty. Finally, man's mind
dictates that man be able to keep the fruits of his mind's labors, since
property enables man to survive. Thus, the system of government which
protects individual rights is the system which protects man's mind and
furthers man's capacity for survival. And that system which protects man's
mind is the system of government which fosters production. Conversely, any
system which does not recognize individual rights inhibits production.
</p>
<p>
This is exactly what happened in the South. The governments and people of
the Southern states did not recognize the inviolability of man's mind.
They believed that labor and industry required nothing but muscle. The
aristocratic, landed gentry lived lives of opulence and idleness while
their black slaves tilled the fields and picked the cotton. The yeoman
farmers, those entrepreneurial farmers who relied on their minds to
increase production, that had always been a part of Southern society had
moved on to the West. These same governments were also among the most
proactive ones around in that they were based on the political philosophy
of Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes believed that people, if left to their own
devices, would soon become mired in conflict. Therefore, they enter into a
social contract&mdash;giving their rights up to the government&mdash;in
order that their society may be ordered and orderly. The government then
grants them rights as citizens of that government and these rights may be
taken away should the government so desire. In short, Hobbes believed in
the absolute State. <cite>Slavery, Law, and Politics</cite> mentions the
instance of a law regarding free blacks in South Carolina. After an
insurrection was discovered and quashed, the liberties of any free black
were similarly crushed. When a vessel came to port, all the black crew
members were summarily arrested and held in jail until their ships left
port. Examples abound of the abrogated rights of both free blacks and
enslaved blacks. Blacks did not have freedom of movement or freedom of
association. They had but limited property rights and could be executed
for trying to secure their liberties. The Southern government not only did
not recognize individual rights, but they did not recognize blacks as
individuals. They saw blacks as means to their ends. They were literally
regarded as chattel. In reality, blacks had (and still do, of course) the
same minds and rationality that the whites did (and still do, of course).
</p>
<p>
This philosophic evasion was the direct cause of the South's relative
poverty. Because they did not recognize the import of the mind, they could
not understand the method of production. Because they did not recognize
that men are ends in themselves, they could not discover the trader
principle&mdash;that two people exchange goods for mutual benefit. Because
the Southern governments did not recognize the metaphysical nature of
individual rights, their political systems could not promote
industrialization. The South became stagnant, just as an individual does
if he does not use his mind.
</p>
<p>
This stagnation was confined to the South because the North was much more
aware of the political responsibilities that come with
industrialization&mdash;freedom is to be protected at all costs. To be
sure, the North was not fully consistent and would have prospered even
more if it had been. The times being what they were, we could not have
expected more from the Northern states. The economic system of the North
rewarded productivity by the profit motive; the Southern economic system
punished unproductiveness by the whip.
</p>
<p>
The preceding paragraphs explicated the philosophical reason why the black
slavery system of labor was established, why it expanded, and why it was
confined to the South. But there were many other factors. The climate and
soil of the North was ill-suited to extremely large and profitable crops,
which necessitated large numbers of field workers. The North had a large
enough labor pool already. The South developed the plantation system,
which required large amounts of land and labor. Also, racism was much more
prevalent in the South. Finally, in the colonial period, the King and
Parliament deemed that slavery should exist primarily in the South. These
factors are all well and good, but they do not really answer the 'why' of
the aforementioned questions&mdash;they do not examine the philosophic
underpinnings of the institution of slavery.
</p>
<p>
But why did such a horrible institution last for so long? Slavery was not
abolished until the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. The Northern states had
long recognized the immoral nature of servitude, most of them having
abolished the institution by 1800. The reason: slavery was such a hot
issue at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and the philosophic
argument against it was not entirely formulated, that the Founding Fathers
neglected to categorically reject the institution in the new Constitution.
As such, the Southern delegates got language inserted that was, in fact,
rather agreeable to the institution of slavery. For example, the Southern
states argued that the Constitution's enumerated rights applied only to
citizens of the United States. They further contended that the blacks were
not really citizens and could not, therefore, enjoy the liberties that
full citizens enjoyed. They also got the odious institution officially
recognized in the apportionment clauses of the Constitution. Finally, they
were able to appeal to the Constitution when a slave escaped: there was a
clause in Article IV that was essentially an ambiguously-worded
fugitive-slave law. But all these Constitutional provisions simply allowed
the institution of slavery to exist and flourish. Many slave owners,
particularly in the years prior to the Civil War, believed that the
federal government actually had a responsibility to protect slavery. They
believed that the Constitutional duty to "insure domestic Tranquility"
meant that any internal turmoil that slavery produced was inimical to the
Constitution. Therefore, the government must quell abolitionist
propaganda. In fact, the Congress did just that. For many years, the "gag
rule" was law&mdash;abolitionists could not seek a vote on the elimination
or limitation of slavery. To an extent, suppressing abolitionism did
insure domestic tranquility. When the "gag rule" was lifted, the Civil War
soon followed. Surely, the abolitionist movement did not cease to exist,
but it did not have a voice. And without a voice, the abolitionists were
powerless.
</p>

The North and the South's economic systems were consequences of the
philosophies that dominated their cultures. There were many factors that
influenced the form of those consequences, but the prime factor was the
role of man's mind in the two disparate economies. The South, being
agricultural and stagnant, did not recognize the crucial part the mind
played in production. The North, realizing the mind's importance,
industrialized and became the industrial heart of the United States for
most of its history.

<br />As promised yesterday, I watched <a href="http://www.adultswim.com/shows/birdman/">Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law</a>, <a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/">Cartoon Network</a>'s interesting new adult cartoon show, last night. The show's premise is that Birdman (an obscure cartoon hero from the sixties) is a lawyer defending other obscure cartoon characters. The episode from last night was the second half of an episode about Birdman killing DynoMutt. If this sounds bizarre, it was.<br /><br />It was also extremely interesting. I've always been fascinated by the taking of things out of their conventional context. That's the reason I liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008Z44R/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>The Brady Bunch Movie</cite></a>, the movie where the Brady Bunch is brought into the context of the '90s. I know that such decontextualization is completely <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/English/ENGL2012Klages/pomo.html"><acronym title="postmodernism">pomo</acronym></a>, but is it really so bad if I just enjoy it in an artistic way? That doesn't mean that I'm a postmodernist, does it? I find Derrida a bore and Lacan completely obtuse.<br /><br /><br />

<br /><a href="http://www.rageboy.com/">Chris Locke</a> has a new <a href="http://www.rageboy.com/2003_07_01_blogger-archive.html#105770843715867761">blog entry</a> along the lines of my <a href="2003_06_22_diamonds.cfm#105665595929535007">earlier entry about why I blog</a>. Well, the point of the entry is along the lines of mine, but the execution is more consonant with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671448315/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="Amazon link"><cite>Real Men Don't Eat Quiche</cite></a>.<br /><br />The things he lists as characteristic of bloggers (versus some other category of people he labels "narcissists"&#x2014;a very odd dichotomy to be sure) certainly don't apply to me. Bloggers trade in ad hominem attacks? Huh? I can only think of a couple that do that. Irritated? Not particularly. I guess what really bothers me about RageBoy's post is that it glories in self-importance and self-aggrandizement. These are not the reasons why I blog.<br /><br /><br />

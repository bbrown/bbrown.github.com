<br />Yesterday, my <a href="#request.imagesroot#/speedway/racecrew.jpg" title="That's me in the middle.">posse and I</a> went to <a href="http://www.speedwayraceway.com/">Speedway Raceway</a>, an indoor cart racing track in a warehouse in south Phoenix. For only $16&#x2014;because I got a membership for $20&#x2014;I did fifteen laps around their quarter-mile track. Best time: 35.60 seconds. Also, I came in last due to a blunder in a tight turn. D'oh!<br /><br />The speedway is an awesome place to race small little carts. It's got a winding, tight track and the carts go about 30-35 m.p.h. in my estimation. Plus, it's got a tunnel&#x2014;you've got to love a tunnel. One of these days I'll put up pictures for you, the viewing public.<br /><br /><br />

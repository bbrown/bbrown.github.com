<br />Yesterday, I was jonesing for some <a href="http://www.hewnandhammered.com/pho/">pho</a> and planned on going to <a href="http://envquery.maricopa.gov/envscrp/pbisa70.dll/emsservr/uo_emsserver/f_perm_inspection_results?as_cat=4&amp;al_perm_id=65931">Saigon Healthy Deli</a>. I drove down Mill Avenue but couldn't find it. So I stopped at a Circle K and called the restaurant to discover that they're remodeling presently. Oh well, I guess I'll have to wait to taste <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho">pho</a>.<br /><br />Completely forgetting that I had an excellent selection of California rolls in the refrigerator back at work, I drove around Tempe looking for some culinary action. I found an unassuming little restaurant called <a href="http://envquery.maricopa.gov/envscrp/pbisa70.dll/emsservr/uo_emsserver/f_perm_inspection_results?as_cat=4&amp;al_perm_id=29649">Little Szechuan</a> and thought that it might be worth a try. It had the makings of a dive and was atrociously decorated in the standard, over-the-top Chinese restaurant way.<br /><br />Waiting to order, I was surprised at all the <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> talk I overheard. I'm used to hearing the normal banal banter of lunchtime conversation so I was pleasantly surprised. The surprise was heightened when my waitress came to take my order.<br /><br />She was holding a <acronym title="Personal Digital Assistant">PDA</acronym> of some sort with a wireless nub to connect with some kitchen-based server. She tappity-tappity-tapped my order in and moved on to the next table. The strangest thing is that it was literally the first time I had ever seen a restaurant use such an ordering system. It made me wonder just how deep the technology permeated the establishment. <br /><br />Oh and the food can best be described as "enh."<br /><br /><br />

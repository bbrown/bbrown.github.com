<br />If there is a hell&#x2014;and I don't think there is&#x2014;then I think an especially putrid level should be reserved for those moronic cow-orkers who use corporate mail systems to generate unsolicited commercial email <em>aka</em> spam. What sort of mentality thinks that everyone cares to read their drivel? At home, I can <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/jaguar/mail.html">get rid of the spam</a> but at work it's not often obvious when something is spam since people craft sucky subjects.<br /><br />In the last week, I've had some idiot asking 10 departments if anyone plays <a href="http://www.bungie.com/products/halo/halo.htm">Halo</a>, about five scalping tickets to <a href="http://www.azdiamondbacks.com/">Diamondbacks</a> games, and one this morning&#x2014;IN ALL CAPS, NATCH&#x2014;soliciting a home for a "SWEET AND WONDERFUL COCKER SPANIEL" of indeterminate gender ("HE/SHE IS ...").<br /><br />I've set up Outlook rules to capture most of the common variations (tickets, ticket, Diamondbacks, Cardinals&#x2014;like we get any of those, dog, dogs, cats, cat), but the morons keep changing their wording. Just like their Internet brethren.<br /><br /><br />

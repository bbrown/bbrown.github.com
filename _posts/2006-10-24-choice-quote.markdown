"One of the cool things about being an optimist is that quite often I believe I have come up with an idea that will change the world. This is a wonderful feeling that lasts from the moment I think of the idea until the moment I realize I'm full of shit. That's why I often keep my best ideas to myself. That way I can savor their splendidness longer, free from the brutality of reason and information. But ultimately I must set each idea free, so that it might take wing for about a minute and a half before someone shoots it like skeet and stomps on it with a manure-scented boot." -- <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/10/optimist_cures_.html">Scott Adams</a>

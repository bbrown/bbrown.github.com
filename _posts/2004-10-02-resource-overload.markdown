<br />I love <a href="http://www.resourceshelf.com/">Resource Shelf</a> because its maintainers do an awesome job of compiling great sources of information. I used to follow it daily, but I stopped because it rapidly became impossible to keep up. I don't know how they do it. I subscribed to their feed, but each entry had a dozen or more links to check out and there were 20 or more entries a day!<br /><br />So when I heard that <a href="http://www.docuticker.com/">DocuTicker</a> would be a little more focused but maintained by the same people, I was excited. Unfortunately, there's effectively just as many Web resources that relate to documents as there are in the larger category.<br /><br />They're still great sites, but I just don't have the time.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I was just visiting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> and I noticed the Segway HT icon at the top left corner&#x2014;I know it's been there forever, but I just saw it again. I decided to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007EPJ6/bbrown-20/ref=nosim/" title="If you buy one, I think I'll get a bundle!">click</a> on it since I don't recall ever doing so.<br /><br />Strangely, none of the normal Amazon items like customer reviews or ratings are available. You don't think normally-quite-open Amazon is afraid of bad reviews about this thing that made Bezos giggle, do you?<br /><br /><br />

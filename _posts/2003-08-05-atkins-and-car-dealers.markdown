<br />Two informative articles on <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org">Kuro5hin</a> today: "<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/8/3/1363/67294">Low Carbohydrate Diets: Revolution or Quackery?</a>" and "<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/8/4/163150/0581">Selling cars in the U.S. - the inside scoop</a>".<br /><br />I've long been skeptical of Atkins' Diet. It seems too good to be true. I've read his book; it reads like so many examples of pseudo-science couched in scientific terms. I've tried the diet for about a month: it made me cranky, sluggish, and I didn't lose much weight at all. I've lost much more weight this year by eating less and exercising more.<br /><br />Car buying sucks. I dread having to buy a new car every single time. My dream is either a) a car that lasts at least 10 years or b) a disposable car that costs $500 and lasts a year or two. One allows me to avoid the dealer for a long time and the other would allow me to avoid the dealer entirely.<br /><br />[UPDATE: <a href="http://www.mistergin.net/">Eric Johnson</a> referred to an article at <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/">edmunds.com</a> where the editors hired an investigative reporter to go undercover as a car salesman. He didn't provide a link, but I've <a href="http://apps.edmunds.com/advice/buying/articles/42962/article.html?tid=edmunds.n.mainindex.advice.buying.4.*">found it</a> and it's more in-depth than the Kuro5hin one.<br /><br /><br />

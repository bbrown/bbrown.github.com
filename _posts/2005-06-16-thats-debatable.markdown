<br />FYI: an argument is <a href="http://www.answers.com/moot">moot</a> when those arguing should be <a href="http://www.answers.com/mute">mute</a>. If you can't get these straight, may I recommend the lovely "debatable?"<br /><br />[UPDATE (6/17/05): "Irrelevant" would also work in some contexts.]<br /><br /><br />

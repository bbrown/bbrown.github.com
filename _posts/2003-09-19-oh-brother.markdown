<br />I knew it was bound to happen. It was only a matter of time. The <a href="http://www.appleturns.com/reruns/action.las?-database=atat&amp;-layout=web&amp;-response=%2freruns%2freruns_hitlist.las&amp;-op=bw&amp;mail=michael%20dell&amp;-maxRecords=10&amp;-search">precedent</a> is just too well-established. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">product</a> was just <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/08/28/technology/apple/?cnn=yes">too successful</a> to not be copied.<br /><br />Of course, I'm talking about <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/09/19/HNaxims_1.html">Dell's mp3 player plans</a>.<br /><br />[UPDATE (9/27/03): Details <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/6865977.htm">emerge</a> about Dell's plans: the Digital Jukebox (DJ, ugh!) is a rebranded Creative mp3 player and the music service will be a rebranded version of MusicMatch's upcoming online music store. <em>Quelle Dell!</em>]<br /><br /><br />

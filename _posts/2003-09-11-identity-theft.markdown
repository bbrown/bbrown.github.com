<br />In an interesting column on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20030911.html">identity theft</a>, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/">Robert Cringely</a> concludes with this paragraph:<blockquote>This sort of crime is eventually going to happen. If I can do it just about anyone can do it. The take probably won't be $65 billion, but it will be in the multiple billions. Once it sinks in what has happened, the financial world and the world of business will never be quite the same again as yet another shred of our innocence is torn away. And government will likely respond with new laws that won't work and with a profound lack of understanding of its own role in the tragedy. But first they'll start an investigation.</blockquote><br />Mighty ironic words considering the day on which they were published.<br /><br /><br />

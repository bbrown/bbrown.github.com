<br />I love my current host, <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a>, for so many different reasons, but <a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/2005/08/08/why-web-hosting-is-easy/">this blog entry</a> about their business model made me grin. I've never seen a business actually state that it earns a 2,000% margin! And not apologize for it or downplay it at all. It's refreshing and makes me glad that I'm with them. (Actually, I wish that I could be starting right now so I could say that that entry is the reason.)<br /><br /><br />

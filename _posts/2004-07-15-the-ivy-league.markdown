<br /><a href="http://www.redmonk.net/">Steve Ivy</a>, master of <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/">nigritude ultramarine</a>, has finally finished importing the archives and they stretch back to June 2000. As a fellow Phoenician (transplant from the Old Dominion) and Mac OS X afficionado, <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/">Steve Ivy</a> is the local face of blogging for me and a friend. And now his transition from Conversant to WordPress is complete.<br /><br /><br />

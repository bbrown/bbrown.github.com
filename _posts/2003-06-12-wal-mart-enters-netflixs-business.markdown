<br />Since I <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/06/11/1929237&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=188&amp;tid=97">submitted the story</a> to Slashdot about <a href="http://www.walmart.com/">Wal-Mart</a> entering <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>'s online DVD renting space, I thought I should probably clarify my statement that "At the very least, that's not going to be good for business." It's a reference to a hilarious <cite>Seinfeld</cite> episode about <a href="http://216.239.57.100/search?q=cache:v6qbei1A9H8J:www.drodd.com/seinfeld/TheChickenRoaster.htm+seinfeld+%22not+going+to+be+good+for+business%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" title="Google Cache saves the day!">Kenny Rogers' Roasters</a>.<br /><br />Personally, I think this is going to be very good for business. I'm a <a href="2003_03_16_diamonds.cfm#90971086">big fan of Wal-Mart</a> and I think their entry both legitimizes the market and increases the innovation there. I mostly meant that their entry isn't going to be good for Netflix's business and anyone who thinks differently is <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=67286&amp;threshold=3&amp;commentsort=0&amp;tid=188&amp;tid=97&amp;mode=thread&amp;pid=6174577#6174838" title="My explanation of my comment and an alternate comment.">probably</a> an ex-high official of the Iraqi Information Ministry.<br /><br />I'm still surprised that my story generated 642 comments. Wow!<br /><br />[UPDATE 7/13/03: I got a record 662 page views off of that story. Very neat!]<br /><br /><br />

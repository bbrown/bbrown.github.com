<p>
I used to review movies here all the time, giving them a sentence or two and capturing my opinion briefly. I liked the format, but I just never kept it up. Here's the movies I've seen this year so far:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN//ref=nosim/bbrown-20/"><cite>The Raid: Redemption</cite></a>: this is a super-violent action movie from Indonesia but it is possibly the best action movie I've ever seen. Jackie Chan's best is better&mdash;his style of comedy pushes it over&mdash;but this is jam-packed, non-stop action. Beautiful action, at that.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN//ref=nosim/bbrown-20/"><cite>Ted</cite></a>: having been a longtime fan of <a href="http://www.mrwiggleslovesyou.com/" title="It was sick and twisted, but oh-so-funny.">Rehabilitating Mr. Wiggles</a>, I thought this would be a sure-fire laugh riot. It was mostly a raunchy groaner but the scene of partying with Flash Gordon was funny.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00A83075M/ref=nosim/bbrown-20/"><cite>Wreck-It Ralph</cite></a>: good fun for the whole family. It wasn't particularly memorable but it sure beats the deplorable <cite>Madagascar 3</cite> or inane <cite>Ice Age</cite> movies.</li>
</ul>

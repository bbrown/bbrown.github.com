<br />You've all heard a reference to "Badges? We don't need no stinking badges!" but you may not know that it came from <cite>Treasure of the Sierra Madre</cite> starring Humphrey Bogart&#x2014;good movie, by the way. Want to know all of the bookies, movies, and TV shows that have made reference? Naturally, there's a site dedicated to <a href="http://www.darryl.com/badges/">Stinking Badges</a>.<br /><br /><br />

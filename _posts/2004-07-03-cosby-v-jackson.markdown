<br /><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=494&amp;u=/ap/20040701/ap_en_tv/cosby_comments_4&amp;printer=1">Bill Cosby's remarks</a> about the source of black's economics woes must have caused some internal consternation at Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition conference. I have a newfound respect for the erstwhile comic; between <cite>The Cosby Show</cite> and now, he's mostly&#x2014;save for the Ennis incident&#x2014;been out of the limelight.<br /><br />I wish that he would have struck deeper at the root of the black community's problems&#x2014;it's general disdain for intellectual pursuits and success through hard work. Instead, he focused on bad grammar and only briefly touched on some of the factors that would prevent a n-word&#x2013;spouting black kid from becoming a doctor. Further he hinted that the black kids of today should work at bringing themselves up to the American way of life out of a debt to the civil rights crusaders of yesteryear. That's unfortunate since it sets up the worst reason for bettering yourself: duty.<br /><br />At any rate, he's a welcome contrast to most of the armchair-politician celebrities.<br /><br />[NOTE: Lest my point be misconstrued, I am not suggesting that the disdain I refer to is universal in the black community. Cosby himself is a profound example of that.]<br /><br /><br />

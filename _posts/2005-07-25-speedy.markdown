<br />Wow, I thought I'd take <a href="http://speakeasy.net/speedtest/">this speed test at work</a> since the connection <em>always</em> seems zippier than any other I've ever experienced. The results: 11,832 kbps down and 1743 kbps up. Crikey!<br /><br />[UPDATE: My co-worker pointed out that running a test at 6:40 am isn't really representative of the company since it's just me, the security guard, and third-shift call center workers. So I just ran it again: 10,585 kbps down and 1728 kbps up. Still pretty damn impressive!]<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

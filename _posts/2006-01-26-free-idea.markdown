I bet you could make a mint selling a comforter that was split into two sections but still connected at the bottom. Then one bed occupant could have the comforter all the way up to his neck while the other one could have it completely off. I'd buy one&#x2014;I'd make a business out of it if I had any notion of what it would take to get into textiles. Since I don't, you're welcome to it. (Just send me a link to where I can buy it once you get it going.)

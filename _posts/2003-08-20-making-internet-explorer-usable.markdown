<br />For all of your Internet Explorer lovers out there (hey <a href="http://www.defrane.com/">Todd</a>), <a href="http://www.myie2.com/">MyIE2</a> seems like it would make using Internet Explorer worthwhile. Since you don't seem to want to consider <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/why/">Mozilla Firebird</a>, MyIE2 has a lot of the same features: tabbed browsing, popup blocking, ad blocking, skins, etc. It can also use IE plugins (like the <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">Google Toolbar</a>) and has a smaller memory presence than Internet Explorer. Enjoy!<br /><br /><br />

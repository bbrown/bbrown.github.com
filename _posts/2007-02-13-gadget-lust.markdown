<p>
It never fails. I buy a BlackBerry 7250 and I think it's <a href="http://bbrown.info/2006/09/01/litefeeds-sucks.aspx">the cat's meow</a>. Then the <a href="http://www.blackberrypearl.com/">Pearl</a> comes out and I can live with it by dismissing its reliance on predictive typing. Then those RIM bastards had to go and develop the <a href="http://www.blackberry8800.com/" title="Completely swoon-worthy">8800</a>. I've got nothing to object to, nothing to feel comfortable with my phone. *sigh* Except a two-year contract.

<br />I'm almost done with my sample chapter for the publisher. Why I agreed to do an entire chapter in less than a week is beyond me! It's shaping up to be about 25 pages and 5,200 words or so. I hope that's enough because I've got that whole topic stretched as far as she'll go.<br /><br />I would've been much further along if last night hadn't been occupied by a family get-together to celebrate a special event. I got a few DVDs (which I'll have to remember to add to my <a href="/aboutme/dvds.cfm">list</a>), a CompactFlash card reader, a pizza stone, a real nice pan, tickets to a "Weird Al" concert, and a Frank Lloyd Wright book. Real nice stuff. No <a href="http://www.airzooka.com/">Airzooka</a>, but that's okay.<br /><br /><br />

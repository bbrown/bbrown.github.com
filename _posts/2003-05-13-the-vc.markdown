<br />I just recently encountered a comic strip produced during the height of the dot-com boom, <a href="http://www.thevc.com/"><em>The VC</em></a>. It's pretty crudely drawn, but spot on in its humor. I especially like the ones about <a href="http://www.thevc.com/strips/strip03.html">VC control</a>, <a href="http://www.thevc.com/strips/strip04.html">dumb consultants</a>, <a href="http://www.thevc.com/strips/strip08.html">herd mentality</a>, <a href="http://www.thevc.com/strips/Upside04.html">Jerry Maguire moments</a>, <a href="http://www.thevc.com/strips/strip20.html">vacuous VCs</a>, and <a href="http://www.thevc.com/strips/strip18.html">funding fads</a>. Good stuff.<br /><br /><br />

<br />My cube neighbor just showed me some Javascript code from July 2000 written by <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/">Bob Parsons</a> for our <a href="http://www.starfieldtech.com/products/website_complete.htm">WebSite Complete product</a>. I can't even imagine the work environment where the owner is responsible for writing the loan calculator. Much has changed in the last five years!!<br /><br />[NOTE: The views expressed on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of Go Daddy Software, Inc.]<br /><br /><br />

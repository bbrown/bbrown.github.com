<br />Tonight I saw <cite>Maid in Manhattan</cite> (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0252076">IMDb.com</a>). I was surprised at how much I liked it.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Lopez,%20Jennifer">Jennifer Lopez</a>, but not for any particular reason. I've never heard any of her music <a href="http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?p=dict&amp;String=exact&amp;Acronym=afaik">AFAIK</a> and never seen any of her other moviesthough I wanted to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0225071">Angel Eyes</a> and always thought she was an attractive Fly Girl. She is definitely a good actress and the story, written by <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Hughes,%20John" title="What hasn't he written!">John Hughes</a>, travels <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0101635" title="Adorable kid wins heart of wealthy love interest">familiar</a> <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0091790" title="Rich boy, girl from the wrong side of the tracks: will he accept and love her?">ground</a>.<br /><br />What interested me in particular was that Lopez's character is adamant that she's good enough for anyone, that she is not just some Puerto Rican maid but a person capable and worthy of love. I like that message and I think it easily could have tread the usual stereotypes and had <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Fiennes,%20Ralph">Ralph Fiennes</a> like Lopez in spite of her station. Instead, she makes a principled stand to her mother and he stands up to press and aide expectations. And nothing seemed forced or contrivedan amazing achievement in itself.<br /><br />Plus, I really like Ralph Fiennes though I've only seen him in <cite>Quiz Show</cite>. Sandi paid me an exceedingly nice compliment in comparing his looks to my own. Ahh.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I wasn't sure what all the hoopla was about the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/technologies/h264/">H.264 codec for QuickTime</a> until I saw this <a href="http://www.shapeofdays.com/2005/05/a_demonstration.html">excellent comparison of it with Sorenson 3</a>. A larger-sized video encoded at a lower bit rate looks better than a smaller, bigger video clip&#x2014;that's good stuff!<br /><br />The only thing I'm not clear on is if DVD players support this right now or if it has to wait for the HD-DVD format to take hold.<br /><br />[UPDATE (5/13/05): Jeff Harrell has expanded his already excellent comparison into a <a href="http://www.shapeofdays.com/h264/">full-blown H.264 smorgasbord</a>. Thanks for doing this, Jeff!]<br /><br /><br />

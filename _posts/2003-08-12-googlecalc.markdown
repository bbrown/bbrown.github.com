<br /><a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/08/12#When:8:35:24AM">notes</a> that <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> now has a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=5%2B2">built-in calculator</a>. I'm sure anyone reading that will immediately think, "Enh. Windows and Mac OS X have readily accessible calculators. Maybe I'll use that sometime. Or not. Whatever."<br /><br />Are you depressed? That's a pretty blas&#xE9; attitude there, mister. GoogleCalc, as I'm now fond of calling it, is so much more than that. It converts units ("<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=2+miles+in+microns">2 miles in microns</a>", "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=116+degrees+f+in+c">116 degrees in celsius</a>") and seems to be able to understand pretty <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=20+feet+%2B+37+inches+%2B+27+mm+in+miles">complex conversions</a> at that.<br /><br />My favorite is one that I was confronted with this weekend: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=1+1/4+cups+/+2+in+cups">1 1/4 cups / 2 in cups</a>&#x2014;half the pancake recipe on the back of Jiffy Mix. I rounded it up to 2/3 cup.<br /><br />[UPDATE: <a href="http://www.markcarey.com/googleguy-says/">GoogleGuy</a> offers a <a href="http://www.markcarey.com/googleguy-says/archives/discuss-google-calculator.html">few</a> <a href="http://www.markcarey.com/googleguy-says/archives/discuss-google-geeks.html">more</a> <a href="http://www.markcarey.com/googleguy-says/archives/discuss-more-geeky-google-calculator-stuff.html">options</a>.]<br /><br />[UPDATE (8/14/03): <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> figured out <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/08/14/calculator">how</a> to get 42 out of the GoogleCalc, something which Google-Guy hinted at. I tried quite a few variations, but didn't get it. The way, in case you don't feel like clicking over is "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything">answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything</a>". Someone else noticed that if you feed it numbers spelled out, it returns the answer <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=six+times+nine">spelled out</a>. This is such an innovative implementation of a mundane feature.]<br /><br />[UPDATE 2 (8/15/03): <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/">Kuro5hin</a>'s got a great <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/8/14/21307/5189">article</a> outlining a lot of the non-obvious features.]<br /><br /><br />

<br />There's a <a href="http://news.com.com/2008-1025-5094753.html?tag=nefd_acpro">good interview</a> with <a href="http://www.evhead.com/">Evan Williams</a> up over at <a href="http://news.com.com/" title="What a grotesque URL!">CNET</a>. Evan is the founder of <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>&#x2014;the software used to power this and the other blogs at the Bill Brown Information Center&#x2014;and is now working for <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, which bought his company.<br /><br />Evan and his employees have created an <a href="http://www.shellen.com/jason/archives/2003_05_01_default.asp#105251741771289488">internal version of Blogger</a> called <acronym title="Blogger In Google">BIG</acronym> that he says has taken off. According to Evan, several hundred Google employees use blogs internally to track projects, share links, and whatnot. That is so cool: I've suggested to my employer numerous times how internal blogs could really work wonders on reporting and project management. I believe I will pass him this link as further data.<br /><br /><br />

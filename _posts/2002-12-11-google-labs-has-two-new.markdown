<br /><a href="http://labs.google.com/">Google Labs</a> has two new experiments up: <a href="http://labs.google.com/gviewer.html">Google Viewer</a> and <a href="http://labs.google.com/cgi-bin/webquotes">Google WebQuotes</a>. I'm still not sure about the latter, but the former is awesome!<br /><br /><br />

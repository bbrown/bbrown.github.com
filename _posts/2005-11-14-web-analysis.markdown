<br />Okay, this is all over the blogs this morning but I have to talk about it because it's a subject near and dear to my heart. As some of you may know, I track my browser stats religiously. I've developed a shell script that pulls down my logs from my host, gzips them, and then prepares five reports from the data. When I had my laptop at my last job, I would pull down the logs several times a day. I only combed through them during breaks or when I got home, but I still needed to know about the traffic my site was enjoying.<br /><br />My new host, <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?wcbrown">Dreamhost</a>, prepares three reports using <a href="http://www.analog.cx/">Analog</a> automatically every day. That's been close enough for me so I don't run my own reports on every domain I administer. DH's reports don't cover everything my own reports do, but they're close enough and close enough is good enough for a lazy person.<br /><br />So the big news today is that Google has finally unveiled the fruits of <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/urchin.html">their Urchin acquisition</a>: <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>. Since I'm fairly familiar with Urchin's reporting capabilities, I signed up <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/11/circle-of-analytics.html">as soon as I heard</a>. Urchin has a Javascript-based tracking code snippet that will gather visitor information in real-time and generate reports. The best news of all is that it's free and easy, both of which make it a no-brainer for me.<br /><br />All my base are belong to Google.<br /><br /><br />

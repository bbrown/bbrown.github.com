<br />There's an interesting discussion taking place between <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/">Tom Coates</a> and <a href="http://www.caoine.org/">Emma</a> on the subject of <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/08/on_the_existence_of_god.shtml">atheism</a> vs. <a href="http://caoine.org/mt/archives/2003_08.php#001172">agnosticism</a> with <a href="http://caoine.org/mt/archives/2003_08.php#001174">two</a> <a href="http://caoine.org/mt/archives/2003_08.php#001175">followups</a>.<br /><br />I agree with Tom about not understanding how anyone can buy into the idea of religion. I don't, however, feel any compunction to argue the point with anyone. It fits in with my general philosophy of stay the hell out of my life and I'll stay out of yours. You want to believe that there's a supernatural deity who takes an active interest in your life, more power to you. Think there's a hundred deities? Same difference to me, you better get a-worshippin'! I think you're wrong in a big way and that's fine with me. That is, until and unless you want to try and cram your beliefs down my throat. That's where I draw the line. Thankfully, Americans are largely in agreement with my approach so everyone's happy.<br /><br /><br />

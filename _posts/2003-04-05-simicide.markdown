<br /><a href="http://www.techtv.com/">TechTV</a> offers up a <a href="http://www.techtv.com/extendedplay/videofeatures/story/0,24330,3420699,00.html">guide to killing your Sims</a>. I've done each of these. My favorite variation on the theme of deprivation is to get the Sim outside and build a fence around him&#x2014;or as I like to think of it, his "pen." He'll do the exhaustion thing that she describes in the guide, but he'll also make puddles as he loses bladder control.<br /><br />Good times.<br /><br /><br />

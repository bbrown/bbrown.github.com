<br />I didn't see it (and I'm really not interested in watching it, thank you very much), but I like the idea of Madonna and Britney Spears' kissing as <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,1034559,00.html">"the most corporate pucker-up of all time."</a> Later, "the brief dynastic coupling seemed formulated to help Britney lurch into a more racy adult market while allowing Madonna to allege she still has the power to shock."<br /><br /><br />

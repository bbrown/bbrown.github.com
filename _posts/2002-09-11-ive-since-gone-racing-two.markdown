<br />I've since gone racing two more times and have improved my times each visit. I'm up to 34.04 seconds to complete a lap, but I think I've plateaued. Next time I go, I'm going to go for two races in a row and see if I can't nail down my racing problem.<br /><br />Last time I went was with my dad on Sunday. He's been to <a href="http://www.bondurant.com/">Bondurant</a> and he gave me a couple of pointers, which I won't reveal here for obvious reasons!<br /><br /><br />

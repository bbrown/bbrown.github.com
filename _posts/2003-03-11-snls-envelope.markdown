<br /><a href="http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/" title="Official site">Saturday Night Live</a> never fails to astound me. It's been on TV for <a href="http://www.io.com/~serpas/SNL/epguide.html">over 28 years</a> now and it's still shocking sensibilities.<br /><br />The <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/02/02m.phtml" title="List of sketches">week</a> with <a href="http://cgi.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=40204" title="Fark is Walken-happy!">Christopher Walken</a> was inspired. From the <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/02/02mangus.phtml" title="Say it fast!">Colonel Angus sketch</a> to the <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/02/02mraft.phtml" title="I'd like to apologize for ... the gay stuff.">life raft election sketch</a>, Walken really shone and the writing was particularly entertaining&#x2014;the <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/02/02mpranksters.phtml">Pranksters sketch</a> was a little juvenile but still funny.<br /><br />I think the most envelope-pushing sketch that I saw was <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/98/98ajingleheimer.phtml" title="One of the few uses of the name Umberto in American TV.">Jingleheimer Junction</a>.<br /><br /><br />

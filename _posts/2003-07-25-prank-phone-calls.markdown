<br />As a child, I used to make a lot of prank phone calls. I don't know how I ever pulled off most of them because I had a <strong>very</strong> youthful voice. Unfortunately, time has erased most of my memories of the specific details but I remember having a good time.<br /><br />Kids today have it easy with the advent of <a href="http://www.soundboards.com/">soundboards</a>, convenient Flash executables with canned phrases from celebrities. You can keep someone <a href="http://www.ugo.com/channels/freestyle/features/celebritypranks/default.asp">going</a> for quite a long time with those babies. Like many things stemming from the Internet, you just have to be quick on your toes.<br /><br /><br />

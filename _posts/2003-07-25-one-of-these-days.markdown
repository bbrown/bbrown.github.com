<br />One of these days I'm going to replace the badges in the left navigation with some of these <a href="http://www.gtmcknight.com/buttons/">cute little buttons</a>. The <a href="http://www.gtmcknight.com/buttons/humor.php">funny ones</a> are, well, funny. If you like the font on these little guys, you can get it from <a href="http://www.kottke.org/">Jason Kottke</a>, creator, and it's called <a href="http://kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/index.html">Silkscreen</a>.<br /><br /><br />

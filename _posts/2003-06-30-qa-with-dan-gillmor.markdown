<br /><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/"><cite>ComputerWorld</cite></a>, a magazine I read regularly, has a <acronym title="Question And Answer">Q&amp;A</acronym> session with <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/">Dan Gillmor</a> of the <cite>San Jose Mercury News</cite> regarding the new announcements from Apple. I'm not particularly sure why Dan was singled out by the magazine on this particular topic, on which he isn't an expert as far as I know, but it does make for good reading and it promotes Apple, which is good in itself.<br /><br /><br />

<br />I'm watching a new animated version of <a href="http://www.mtv.com/onair/spider-man/">Spider-Man on MTV</a>. Very strange: I've heard absolutely nothing of it, but it's visually impressive. I came into the episode midstream, so I can't comment on the writing as a whole. But it sounds pretty good so far and the line-up is impressive: Neil Patrick Harris as Peter Parker, Lisa Loeb&#x2014;I've got all of her CDs&#x2014;as Mary Jane, and Ian Ziering as Parker's friend.<br /><br />[UPDATE: I've now watched two additional episodes and I have to say that I am totally sold. I think I've found something more for TiVo's voracious appetite. Also, this episode I'm watching now has James Woods voicing the villain.]<br /><br /><br />

Tomorrow I'm flying to frigid Salt Lake City, Utah to attend <a href="http://www.ng-conf.org/" title="I get the reason behind the name, but it is so difficult to talk about. Tell someone you're going to 'en-gee-conf', even someone who knows what Angular is, and you're going to have to repeat it several times along with a further explanation.">ng-conf</a>. I'm so excited! I haven't been to a conference in several years (I think WWDC 2009 was the last one) and this one's sold out.

My new role (details coming soon) involves a lot of JavaScript and Angular is my preferred MVC framework. I may use this blog for some public notes in the next two days. Or I may just continue to let this thing lay dying of neglect. Time will tell.
